train,;/I was annoyed by this same thing just yesterday—but when using Microsoft’s official docs.,;/2
train,;/I totally feel you man 1) find how an certain function works 2) re-Google how to import such function,;/2
train,;/Done: import X from "../../../../../../../../home/Otroletravaladna/definitelynotporn/whatever";,;/1
train,;/Also, please notate which file the code is supposed to go in when there's more than one. It definitely helps.,;/1
train,;/May I ask? Why doesn't the remote ssh allow the C# intellisense? Many extensions need to be installed on the server in order to function,;/0
train,;/They are the worst offender !,;/2
train,;/Weirdly, my VS Code actually updated during the day. The previous version would detect the C# file and tell me it could look for an extension that could handle C# but it didn't find anything. It was putting an @id:vs-code something in the search term. I don't remember the exact string. So after VS Code updated it did find the C# extension and installed it, but still no Intellisense in my code :( It does install vscode server on the Raspberry Pi, and I deleted it and got it to reinstall after the upgrade but it didn't help. I should probably dig around the language server debug window and see if I can find out why I used to write C code using a text editor and nmake so I'm used to having to compile to actually find the errors in my code :),;/2
train,;/Yeah, they sometimes include the whole file except the includes...,;/2
train,;/Oddly enough, on my end it works without issue - upon installing on the server,;/2
train,;/If you develop C or C++ you'll know the anguish of finding exactly the .h file you need for your project to work, and then scouring the internet for the .lib file that matches it,;/2
train,;/Wait till you spend a week chasing down a bug which ends up being a sum total of 5 characters.,;/2
train,;/Yeah that's normal. A lot of the hardest problem are like that, the change to get the desired outcome could be anything but there is only one good solution and it's not easy to figure out what it is. Sometimes it's small but sometimes it's not. Either way it's usually a lot more time researching than it is coding. You should feel good about it. Being able to find an easy solution to a complex problem by reading documentation is what makes a good engineer.,;/1
train,;/Absolutely.,;/1
train,;/yup,;/1
train,;/It can be way worse than that.,;/1
train,;/That’s engineering in general,;/1
train,;/Any line of code you write is a line of code that's untested and needs to be maintained. The more you can get by reading docs as opposed to hacking it together yourself, the better. Once you've spent a lot of time with the frameworks and libraries you're using you'll probably be able to spend more time coding and less time reading docs. But early on in a project it's definitely reasonable to spend a LOT of time reading documentation.,;/1
train,;/I once spent more than a week chasing down a bug that ended up being a single unprintable character.,;/2
train,;/8 weeks. Code broke in an update. After the first week I had to take other tickets and work on it in spare time. One variable needed to be set. One line of code. Variable wasn't even used, but was throwing a nullpo at some point in unmanaged code. I was on both polar sides of livid and relieved.,;/2
train,;/I spent 2 weeks figuring out why a container couldn't reach the internet, and with no ideas left, I checked the IPv6 address again... I'd mistyped one number in it.,;/2
train,;/Ngl if I was a guy in ap computer science (and I am) I would just about die if any girl was willing to bother to write me a letter in binary.,;/2
train,;/Encoding a poem in binary would definitely show that you've put some effort into it and that you are interested in the things he does. I think that this is a great idea and it's not even that difficult to do. If you google a bit, you may be able to find a text-to-binary converter that will do the work for you (don't worry, googling is an essential part of programming),;/1
train,;/The fact you actually listen and maybe question what he says is already a lot.,;/1
train,;/End it with a checksum of the poem. You can then catch him out when he tells you the ending is gibberish.,;/1
train,;/> If you’re a guy who loves computers, what would be the ideal way to be asked out? "Hey! Fancy going for something to drink together?" You're really overthinking this.,;/2
train,;/Unless you were awkward or insecure enough that instead of taking a (not subtle) hint, you'd start doing some odd shit like pointing out mistakes in the encoding. OP, keep in mind some people are utterly clueless in terms of dating. I myself in high school thought I'm so out of my SO's league, that it took me a year of her hinting to make my move.,;/1
train,;/thank you for the converter tip! that would have saved me a lot of time haha,;/1
train,;/It's especially good in binary since base two is <3,;/2
train,;/Depending on the length of the poem binary might give you too long of a message. If that'll be the case you could also consider hexadecimal. There are also converters for those,;/1
train,;/Or base64,;/1
train,;/Oh shit is this the legit alpha master tech lead????? Hi!!,;/2
train,;/As a software manager that has also read 100s of resumes at a time these tips are solid. And I wasn't aware companies couldn't ask for your graduation date on a degree that's interesting.,;/1

train,;/The link says unable to open the file at this time. Is it just me or did the OP took it down?,;/0
train,;/I acknowledge your miserable excuse for a piece of barely edible flesh.,;/2
train,;/And they can't ask for dates on your work history, so if you have work history gaps and you're self conscious about it, just leave the dates off. Asking dates opens the company up to lawsuits about age discrimination.,;/1

train,;/It also makes sure nobody will hire you if you decline to answer,;/1
train,;/What you should be doing is projecting the amount they could save by using your software and set your price accordingly so they still save money, but you still get quite a lot for what you wrote. Then argue they can get ahead of their competitors or can wait and play catchup when it may be too late. Ask to sit at the table once again and talk numbers so both parties can win.,;/1
train,;/Absolutely not. If implementing this piece of software was part of your job, then they would be right to expect it, but it sounds like that’s not the case. This is your intellectual property and you have every right to protect it and get paid for it.,;/1
train,;/If they wouldn’t pay $15/month, what makes you think they’ll pay you $10? If you built it for yourself, sell it to someone who will pay, or open source it. If you built it for them without a formal agreement in place, you may be able to fight for some equity or licensing fee, but you’re probably out of luck.,;/1
train,;/It's perfectly normal to ask for money for software that adds value to a company that you wrote in your own time. However; it's not really 'normal' to develop something specifically for a company, dangle it in front of them, and then ask for money. They didn't ask you to build it for them. So you should not be surprised that they won't be willing to pay you for it. And then there is a huge legal grey area where you wrote software in your own time that is very specific to the business processes of a certain company. How much of an issue that is going to be, really depends on your local laws.,;/1
train,;/not unless you've got substantial equity in the company. Find somewhere to work that will appreciate you. 400 people x 1 hr/mo, even at minimum wage would be a solid ~3k / mo in efficiency gained, and that's an extremely conservative estimate. the costs of current inefficiency are probably far beyond that. If they're not willing to pay a little to save a lot, that's their problem,;/1
train,;/The problem here is that he has a very different bargaining position then when you’re selling a product. If they want to be exceptionally shitty they could even threaten to fire him if he doesn’t hand it over. It seems OPs relationship with management is already far from perfect, so he should be careful. Worst case scenario he could even lose his job. Keep in mind that this company doesn’t even want to pay for off the shelf software. Then there’s the issue that even if he ‘sells’ the software, he’s going to now have to maintain it. It does not sound OP is very experienced with whats involved with long term maintenance of software. IMO he got himself into a pretty nasty position by doing all this without discussing this up front. Not something that’s easy to fix.,;/1
train,;/this is fair, but with the caveat that you should absolutely walk away if the company does not want to compensate you in a way that feels fair to you. compensation is not to be expected, but neither was the software, esp developed on your own time.,;/1
train,;/Agree on this completely. It would have been appropriate to gain the alignment on your expectations before starting.,;/1
train,;/> Worst case scenario he could even lose his job. I can imagine scenarios a lot worse than that. Such as a legal battle over ownership of said software.,;/1
train,;/Oh totally. If they don't want to pay, don't give them the software. It's as simple as that.,;/1
train,;/"Take home assignments" have become common, and I actually don't mind them if they're reasonable in size and mean that I won't have to do 4 hours of whiteboard coding on site. But one basically entailed building an entire fucking application. A long time ago, one company gave me a pretty short online quiz that was like: "Here's a horrible made-up language with ridiculous syntax and bizarre semantics. What should these short snippets print?" I thought it was a kind of fun puzzle that tested your ability to be meticulous, but it turns out... it wasn't a fake language, it was the language they actually used.,;/1
train,;/Yeah it happens. I'm generally interviewing the company while they're interviewing me. If a company interviews me in a silly way, verifying I had skills that were not in line with what I know I need to be a programmer, then that tells me either that the company has no idea how to test for competent engineers and thus likely has lots of incompetent engineers, or that I am not right for the job since they want me to do something different than what I want to do. Either way it's useful information to help me walk away quick before my time (and theirs) is wasted even more.,;/1
train,;/4 hour long coding challenge, which is usually designed to be tackled by teams, and which (at least in my perception) had quite a bunch of flaws in the stated acceptance criteria (i.e. highly ambiguous wording and such, which allowed for many different interpretations on what to actually solve). While I passed, I ultimately didn't take the job there.,;/1
train,;/And the worst thing is, this company will probably think that they were right in aplly that test and that you are too lazy to work for then,;/2
train,;/A made up language on hackerrank That in itself is ok. But their made up language didn’t follow standard order of operations in any math problem. Left to right, not BODMAS. They told me this afterwards. They said it didn’t matter for the role I was applying for, which was implementation specialist, no coding involved I did badly, apparently most people fail (!!) and they hired someone that did better,;/1
train,;/I just assume, for better or worse, that they either have no idea what they're doing or are really lazy, and am glad they let me know before I wasted too much time on them.,;/1
train,;/I had a huge arguement with a CIO who wanted me to implement a video-on no-tabbing test for engineers. He was from a programme manager background. He was deeply shocked when I told him how rediculous the test was. He didn't beleive me when I told him that even the best developers check Internet pages when developing code.,;/1
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/I agree. I saw some post quite a while back where someone described how their interview style was very good and those who did not manage, they were glad to not have on the company anyway. There was a bit of a flaw though, it was a while back... but I think it was typically not so fitting for people on the more introvert side. So I suspect they felt like it was a success for them when people tapped out but in reality they probably just missed good opportunities.,;/1
train,;/Well, they do say plagiarism is the highest form of praise.,;/2
train,;/I think people should learn the basics of coding to not fear technology. But I think this movement is giving people the wrong impression at how difficult coding actually is in the real world; it’s not for everyone.,;/1
train,;/I got bombarded with "LEARN DATA SCIENCE IN 30 DAYS!" on Instagram Gotta say, it seemed pretty hilarious, since I've been studying data science for 2 years and I'm still not confident enough for the first job. These ads are straight up scam city. Maybe in 30 days if you're already a computer science professor...,;/1
train,;/I'm gonna go on a slight tangeant I think. There seems to be the this weird combination of know how to code = economic oppurtunity. It's basically marketted to elementary and secondary education as this will get your students jobs. That shouldn't be the goal. Teaching kids to code is teach a different critical thinking skill. That's what all your classes growing up supposed to do. Do you learn a useful skill that has economic oppurtunity? Hell yeah. But I think learning to code should have a bigger goal than just economic ones.,;/1
train,;/Most of it is honestly just easy money preying on people who want easy money. IMO the people who will put in the time to actual learn to code aren’t going to find out about coding from an instagram ad.,;/1
train,;/I'm a professional software developer and it just made me more afraid of technology,;/2
train,;/I think it's more that "coding" is too broad a term anymore. As software and automation become more and more prevalent, the range of ways in which code / programming is applied continues to diversify. E.g. each of these involves pretty different skillsets despite all vaguely falling under coding, and some of them have a huge range of required expertise/knowledge within those domains depending on what your job is. * DevOps / backend automation * IT technicians * Network engineers * Kernel/OS/engine/other low level code * Backend engineering and architecture * Web developers and mobile apps * Embedded systems * Data science etc etc Not to mention peripheral users of programming - even stuff like graphic design and modeling might use lightweight scripting simply for automation purposes.,;/2
train,;/>But I think learning to code should have a bigger goal than just economic ones. my professor said this about 15 years ago now but I find it relevant still to this day: you will meet two types of people in the workforce; those that work to live and those that live to work. you will find plenty of handymen who aren't handy in their spare time, plenty of logistics schedulers who couldn't give a rat's ass about route optimisation on their way to work and plenty of programmers who don't touch a computer after work. I find that some employers heavily encourage "programming is a lifestyle"-thinking, because let's be honest, it benefits them for zero cost, but I also find it a bit weird to be talking down on people entering the workforce with the explicit goal to only meet the skill set the job requires and become more proficient only during work hours - that is quite literally what work-life balance is at it's core. there is to me absolutely nothing wrong with people that see programming as "just another job", because the flip side of that is when people are simply expected to progress during their ***unpaid free time***, you end up in a scenario where your employer schedules no time during your ***paid time*** to meet the required study time to improve your skills to the point where it is required and efficiently get unpaid work out of you.,;/2
train,;/Lol that’s a good way to put it.,;/2
train,;/For example, [the more you learn about time the scarier it is](http://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/01/28/falsehoods-programmers-date-time-zones.html),;/3
train,;/Store timestamps everywhere, use UTC for everything but the frontend. Schedule your vacations close to leap seconds.,;/2
train,;/> Within minutes there's always an army of people asking why I'm doing something that way, when it's completely irrelevant to the question. I had someone the other day say "the problem is you shouldn't worry about concrete types, just behaviour"... which is a completely assinine thing to say, it's irrelevant to the question and he has no idea why I'm asking it. The why I'm having a problem doesn't help solve a minimal reproducible example. It's because a lot of programming questions suffer from the [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem). The "why" is important because it often informs the correct "how.",;/3
train,;/Can you link to your question? I have review and edit rights on SO. I'd be happy to look it over for concrete feedback. You can PM it to me if you'd like.,;/0
train,;/Reddit is actually a really good place to ask questions. Try finding a subreddit for whatever programming language you're using.,;/1
train,;/I can't think of any alternatives, other than reddit. Even if there were good alternatives, the same toxic responders would find their way there. A lot of programmers have big egos that is stroked when they troll other programmers. It's hard to do, but ignore the trolls. They troll because they don't know how to answer your question, or they're afraid to offer advice they might be wrong (because they're afraid of getting trolled themselves.),;/1
train,;/**Xy Problem** The XY problem is a communication problem encountered in help desk and similar situations in which the person asking for help obscures the real issue, (X), because instead of asking directly about issue X, they ask how to solve a secondary issue, Y, which they believe will allow them to resolve issue X.,;/1
train,;/I remember a question from SO where someone was asking for a regex to extract something from a string. Turns out that the string in question was always a valid JSON. OP just didn't know something like that existed. While other people kept suggesting regexes, I suggested to parse the string as JSON and simply access the value. I even got a reply that my answer isn't what OP was asking for. The why, or what you want to achieve, what's the input and output, is very important.,;/2
train,;/The why is important also because most problems aren't truly unique. So if you're running into problems you might be attempting to solve your non-unique problem in a unique way when it's easier and better to use the common approach and solution.,;/2
train,;/In my experience, Reddit is a lot more toxic than StackOverflow, but the few tech specific groups I'm in are usually pretty helpful. StackOverflow certainly has its problems, but I usually see people acting rude to folks who are asking incomplete or vague questions; not criticizing the code in the question at hand. Without reviewing the OPs question it is hard to evaluate the response.,;/1
train,;/good bot.,;/2
train,;/Really? I found most reddit programming subreddits to be a lot friendlier than SO. You're less likely to get an answer on reddit though.,;/1
train,;/There are many industries where this happens. If you're too good at your job, people wonder why they even need you and you get canned. Meanwhile, those bad at their job, which would then require them to get good at justifying their existence, will often be promoted.,;/1
train,;/It's plenty profitable until the business gets sick of your shit and hires someone competent.,;/1
train,;/Well, you can tell this business is top-notch just from the fact they pay someone to fly out every month to fix on-site instead of setting up a VPN.,;/2
train,;/Simething that _barely_ fulfils the requirements is always cheaper than something thats properly designed and allows for future expansion and modification. And that's not unique to software. Throwing together a hut out of planks is cheap, once you need to add a second floor though you are in for a real problem, probably requiring large-scale reworking of your existing structure. On the other hand if you'd have built in some sturdy material from the beginning it would be trivial to add a second floor, but your initial cost would have been higher.,;/1
train,;/Thankfully if you are a good dev you should be able to find a job that values you. In any case I wouldn't want a career where I'm doing the same shitty work for years just because I'm "cheating" my employers out of their money. I'd rather work on interesting things and get paid fairly for it.,;/1
train,;/Its very tricky though because some of the 'bugs' (but not all) were just edge cases that he didn't handle. For example all of the imported user data SHOULD have 'valid' identifiers on key fields such as username, userid as written in the specs, but sure enough the client was having some bad data come through. But instead of just rejecting that individual invalid record (this is how I wrote my code) - the new programmer did not handle these cases and the imports either corrupted the data or completely crashed the service. So then he blames this on external system database which supplies the 'bad' data. So for this particular bug he argued successfully to the client it was their fault, and now for any subsequent bug he kind of has the 'upper hand' to blame on them as now the non technical people have doubts about their internal systems and people. However I don't agree with his argument as I feel any system should fail gracefully. &#x200B; Edit: Another different bug he had to fly out and fix was because his code didn't handle another test case where someone last name had an apostrophe in it (O'Brien). And this crashed the whole system. Basically just random various bugs like this.,;/2
train,;/It is part of a large government agency that has strict rules on the network connectivity in this case.,;/2
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/Ouch, if a ' crashes the system then this guy needs to learn a lot about mysql injections. I think they hired an amateur. I don't know anymore what's best, my goal was always to get it working in the least amount of code. But now a days it seems to be a competition who can use the most classes. And if your simple spaghetti code works faster and better they tell you your code is ugly.,;/1
train,;/I was always taught you never trust the user or the data coming from the DB.,;/2
train,;/The trick is to show you've done some work before asking the question, just say something like I want to do c and I've done a and b etc. If you plain ask how to do this or that they don't like it. This is my personal experience.,;/1
train,;/It may be because beginners on Stack Overflow are very common. Way too common in some tags. Very often they ask really simple questions that can be answered literally in seconds with one Google search. Yet they seemingly (_seemingly_!) didn't bother to google. Many people are _done_ with this kind of newbies. Especially those who flat out dump their home assignment in their question and expect people to solve it. It looks like the term "newbie" slowly transforms to mean "wants his homework done for free without doing any prior research whatsoever". As you can see, the "mean people" could be viewed by newbies as condescending and unhelpful. Could be because they see you as one of these "write me teh codez" newbies as a kind of (possibly erroneous) generalization. It could be better not to say "I'm new, pwease be nice UwU" in your questions.,;/1
train,;/I hope people are not "mean and edgy" but I will say that a lot of beginners on SO don't really know how to properly ask questions. It sounds cliche but essentially many of the beginner questions are just unanswerable without more info and the asker doesn't want to provide that. If you give a simple and clear question, then you will get an answer. If you dump a bunch of code or link to your repo and say "I don't know where the problem is", that just shows you haven't put in the time to narrow down the question. There's sort of a "teach a man to fish" mentality that isn't explicitly spelled out at any point. Experienced devs know how to use breakpoints, read errors, reference the docs, and stuff like that. Learning those skills is actually far more important than getting a specific answer to your question.,;/1
train,;/People seem to respond better if shown what you have tried outside of searching.,;/1
train,;/In the spirit of stackoverflow: [REPOST!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/search?q=stackoverflow&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on),;/3
train,;/I've actually found if you ask a specific question while applying technical detail and a snippet of only relevant code people on stack overflow are really helpful. Having answered a lot of questions myself I have grown to hate the people clearly trying to get others to do their homework with no effort put in on their end.,;/1
train,;/I guess it's time to yeet the I'm new part out,;/2
train,;/This is very true too.,;/1
train,;/Even better when the answer they link to has absolutely nothing to do with your question.,;/2
train,;/One could also read the Help Centre where it's explained that questions are expected to contain a Minimal, Complete and Verifiable Example as well as technical detail. Of course, the people on SO are literally there to help. For example, I _want_ to solve people's issues with their code - it's fun and it hopefully contributes to, like, the community or something like this. The only thing the OP needs to do it to _research like mad_ before asking questions and _prove_ that they indeed did the research and didn't find any acceptable answers.,;/1
train,;/I still find my self googling "\[Programming Language\] Array" for everything. Edit: Thanks for my first silver, friend!!,;/1
train,;/Yup. Switching between Java & C# is hard (foreach & lambdas trip me up). But I can prolly still do VB6 or TI-BASIC if I really needed to. But not Lua/PHP. Comes down to a question of how similar two languages are & how many years I spent w/ them.,;/1
train,;/Yes. Not only is it impossible to remember every little detail for every language and technology you've ever worked with over the years, it's also unnecessary as long as you know where to look them up.,;/1
train,;/I would say it's pretty normal. I am windows programmer . By default I know hundreds of APIs and routines. After a 3 week holiday for example you are suddenly slow and confused about some things. After two days you are where you left,;/1
train,;/Literally googling SQL statements any time I use it, because can't be arsed to remember stuff I last used a few months ago.,;/1
train,;/Working as Full Stack for 10 years now and still searching for some syntax even the most languages i use today. You should not keep everything in your head. Always allocate your space for designs and good approaches for problems. In the and of the Day clean and simple code always wins. TL dr: Remembering everything wont make you a better software engineer. Good design will.,;/1
train,;/I can never remember if I should use *append* or *push* ....,;/2
train,;/So true!!,;/1
train,;/I love TI Basic. It was my second language after liberty basic,;/2
train,;/This. Brushing up your skills is quite easy when the need arises once you have some experience.,;/1
train,;/Taking breaks throughout the day is your friend,;/1
train,;/I'm a veteran programmer and I have spent the better past of the last 10 years of may career fighting exhaustion and fatigue. Mental fatigue is no joke, your mind is like every other part of your body you need to work it to get strong, but it only gets stronger during rest periods. Make sure you're resting well. Good sleep is important, but also make sure your not spending all day programming and then coming home to play computer games and or focus on your computer in your down time. You to let your mind take a break. Another thing that's super important to help focus your mind and build endurance for your thoughts. Physical excersise. go to the gym a few times a week and you notice a huge improvement in your cognitive ability and your ability to focus on work for long periods of time,;/1
train,;/Yeah. Programmers only work like, 2 hours a day. Actual problem solving abstract thinking isn't a thing that happens 8 hours a day on command as much as the suits want you to think.,;/1
train,;/No joke. For me it eithers works Pomodoro style or 8 hour straight no breaks. But that's prob cuz I have ADHD so Idk how that would work for a regular person. In any case I only get tired if the work is boring. Or I am doing 10/11 hours trying to meet a deadline.,;/1
train,;/It's pretty common. [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/01/06/fire-and-motion/](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/01/06/fire-and-motion/) "Sometimes I just can’t get anything done. Sure, I come into the office, putter around, check my email every ten seconds, read the web, even do a few brainless tasks like paying the American Express bill. But getting back into the flow of writing code just doesn’t happen. These bouts of unproductiveness usually last for a day or two. But there have been times in my career as a developer when I went for weeks at a time without being able to get anything done. As they say, I’m not in flow. I’m not in the zone. I’m not anywhere." "What drives me crazy is that ever since my first job I’ve realized that as a developer, I usually average about two or three hours a day of productive coding." This is from Joel Spolsky who is by all accounts a successful software engineer. I relate with that article a lot, and I've heard similar things from some of the most brilliant programmers I know. It's not just programming, every job where you do creative mental work is hard. In grad school (in environmental sciences, not software), my thesis advisor, who was widely considered the most productive faculty member in my department, told me that excluding busywork like e-mail etc. he did about 4 hours of real work per day. There's probably \*some\* people who can consistently hammer out 8 hours of code a day, but I think they are not the norm.,;/3
train,;/Sometimes. Especially right now. I've spent the entire day troubleshooting, and not just one thing. I have to keep switching back to Reddit (or something else) every hour or so to give my brain a break. It actually helps.,;/1
train,;/Problem is I take a break, and just have no motivation to go back and face that problem again.,;/1
train,;/I'm glad I'm not the only one then, I feel bad if I should be working 8 hours be realistically I'm coding for maybe 2-3 hours,;/2
train,;/Every coder I know experiences this (often daily). In fact, if you don't get this feeling often, then I'd say you're not challenging yourself enough! Hopefully you've got enough to do that you can just switch to something more menial when you feel burnt out. It's a great skill to know when you're beaten (for the time-being), and take a break/move on to something else. You'll also often come back and find the problem unravels itself. If you don't have a good mix of taxing/menial tasks, maybe speak to your manager or consider whether the job's right for you.,;/1
train,;/I think I should try that, I always stick to one task and end up wasting so much time being stuck on something. I should try doing something different that's easier,;/2
train,;/Modern programming is very , very broad, that's what leads to some of this feeling, and even web development is overly broad, and honestly it doesn't have to be... Take front end , you have 3 big name frameworks (React,Angular, Vue) each one different each one incompatible and they all sit on top of the JavaScript engine. In the old days you just learned JavaScript with a lot less complexity and you were done.. and there's like a dozen less popular frameworks that do similar things,plus hundreds of libraries and plugins and everyone is using something different, and a year from now half of it will be obsolete and unsupported. I can't count how many times people want me to upgrade their Angular 1 projects, because one thing or another risnt working because it's no longer supported. On the back end same thing , just more language options. A lot of that functionality comes from html 5 standard and browser support. So much of this complexity is not needed. All that to say, yes there's a lot to learn because developers like to develop all kinds of solutions . I would start small learn the basics of the underlying tech, it's not that hard, html5 css 3, css grid, JavaScript,nodejs and or php or python then once you have a handle begin expanding your knowledge. Do some simple web apps , and then graduate to more.complex.. you'll soon find that just using a minimalist foundation you can do virtually any web app. In fact I would argue tpday it's more important to learn external apis and db storage systems as a complent to your basic knowledge. Here's a little secret web pages today aren't really that much "better" in terms of user functionality than they were 5 or even 10 years ago, and the end user DOESNT CARE HOW YOU BUILD IT. So learn the fundamentals and go from there.,;/1
train,;/I had the same feeling when I was starting out I think the biggest issue for me was seeing all these technologies and like you being afraid I didn't know even half of them or how to use them. As you grow as a developer, at least for me, you start to grasp an understanding not of every framework or technology, but the point of them. You start to generalize all these different technologies and they become abstract in your head. You don't need to know every detail on how each technology works but rather the general idea of them. Once you learn one, you can use that experience and juxtapose it with the technology you want to learn. Some examples that come to mind: Didn't know what an ORM was, then I started working with one. Now when I see other ORM articles about something like EF, I'm able to use my experience to basically fill in the gaps about what they're talking about. It probably does some things the same but some things differently and has strengths and weaknesses. Another is sql, whether it's MSSQL or MySQL, I have a basic understanding of the syntax. I work on MSSQL in my day job but can come home and work on a MySQL project because I generally know the idea. Not getting hung up on the details is easier. Backend technologies: I work in dot net but I've got a good understanding on how my backend and front end talk, so if I wanted to work with a backend that's built on a different technology I have an understanding of what I need to do but the implementation details may be different than the backend I work on has. Writing this up I realized that this sounds a lot like decoupling code (ie: a class has a dependency on an interface rather than a class). I need not know every implementation of something like an ORM, front end framework, or backend technology, I just need to know what they do and learn the details if I have to work with one. Once you build that understanding of how different types of technologies work, you'll find it easier to put all these different frameworks and tools into buckets where each bucket is accomplishing some goal or task.,;/1
train,;/The fact that you are able to see all of this stuff that you need to learn says you are on the right track. You can only learn so much at once so pace yourself. You will get there in time and with practice.,;/1
train,;/We are all just a bunch of idiots going beep boop beep bop all day long. You'll get there.,;/1
train,;/You need to learn the concepts, the design pattern, the best practice. All of this cum from experience. The language or a new cloud technology you will need to work on you will learn very fast after the firsts times. For example I learned angular, the next job I needed to use react and I have learnt it in 2 days. I’m only a junior backend developer and not so incredible,;/1
train,;/>Cum,;/2

train,;/It’s overwhelming,;/1

train,;/The company I work for specializes in MLM ERPs. I feel dirty everyday,;/1
train,;/This is a super interesting question, you should cross-post it to a larger sub or AskReddit. I'm interested in the answers,;/2
train,;/I don't know if that counts, but we made a product deliberately slower. Context: The project is a B2B service that had multiple iterations already and one of the first iterations simply won't die because some slower customers simply don't want to switch. Recently, we had to re-implement more or less the entire back end, which we did by basically building a wrapper around the new service and adapting the outward facing interface. Problem was: we've cut the response time almost in half - better speed was one of the selling points of the new service. So now these slow customers would never switch on their own and we had to maintain this old garbage forever! So we just put a delay-logic into the wrapper, so that the new-old service would have the same response time as the old-old service. Usually, I don't like these "features", but in this case, our customers were just lazy and some of them were actively endangering their own customers by pure neglect ("No, we can't use TLS 1.2, can't we just use HTTP? "). So forcing them to use a proper product doesn't seem too bad.,;/1
train,;/We recently made a project for a company where they wanted to track of thier sales and support staff was returning all calls they missed. This means each and every call is tracked and checked to see that it's closed. Employees are fully aware no doubt. But still, this type of policing leads people down a bad scamy path in my opinion.,;/1
train,;/We have a thing that Enables Features. It's a lie. It's Disables them. I loathe it and work on anything else.,;/1
train,;/I made a program that instantly filled your desktop with 0 byte text files named, well, every number for i in range (0,1000). I only did this to myself tho to see if windows flags it as a virus. Spoilers: it doesn't.,;/1
train,;/Bittorrent minimizing isn't a toxic feature, you don't spend a lot of time in the client while downloads need some time, you don't really need it in the taskbar.,;/1
train,;/Honest question: why stay? I don't mean to pretend "find a new job" is easy, at most that's true for a small fraction of programmers with a good location/resume/immigration status. But I'm curious how these places find their programmers if they do feel bad about it.,;/0
train,;/Sure, will do,;/2
train,;/persistence is what gets flagged mostly. make it so that it installs at startup and download through chrome and see what happens,;/2
train,;/School assignments usually come very well specified. They tell you EXACTLY what your code is supposed to do in all cases. In the industry, a lot of times we get assignments that are at least a bit underspecified. Say you're tasked with implementing a new feature. In a well-structured organization, a UX team gives you UI mockups and a PM has refined the ticket enough to include most of the obvious use cases, but it's usually not bulletproof. Part of your job involves figuring out all of the little details. There's also the architecture of the whole codebase to consider. There might be some "quick and easy" way to hack together some new feature, but if it's violating the architecture then that's no good. You often have to do things in a slightly more verbose way that respects abstraction boundaries. And if you're working on a serious product that you hope to sell worldwide, there are all sorts of extra layers you have to work with. You can't just throw text on the screen, you have to get translations made for every language you support. You can't just throw components on the screen, you have to make sure it works on all screen sizes, and that it's properly structured and tagged so that it works with screen readers, oh and also make sure you're not using color as the only indicator of something. You can't just throw data in a database, you have to think about security. You might have to make the application behave differently in different regions due to legal issues. In short, you're almost never doing these little well-specified tricky algorithm things, you're doing things that are much simpler logically, but having to navigate the architecture of a large codebase.,;/1
train,;/Projects typically go on for years. There's an intense development phase lasting a few months followed by many years of maintenance. The vast majority of code in the world is garbage. Most projects are done by a team. You'll be working in a shared code base. You should avoid entry level jobs that let you work alone; you won't learn that way. Here I describe what is often typical. #### Team * 3-6 programmers * 1 scrum master. Not a manager, but does similar work. * 1 Product Owner (PO). The PO is a part-time member that is a business person acting as a proxy for our customers/users. * 1-2 testers. My typical workflow bottom to top: #### Daily 9:00am 10-15 minute "stand-up" meeting. Everyone gets 1 minute to summarize their status. General discussion at end. Discuss blockers and request help if you need any, perhaps to pair with someone else. When at the office, we sit close to each other. We each work 1-6 days a month at home. Most work is done from tickets. You should work on one ticket at time, with a backup one in case you get blocked (e.g. waiting for someone else). You pick a ticket from a backlog, and when done you get another one. A ticket takes 1-4 days. #### Ticket workflow 1. Get ticket from sprint backlog. If none, ask scrum master 1. Git pull from "develop" branch and create new branch from it. 1. Write acceptance test(s) 1. Write code and unit tests, TDD style if possible. 1. Push to git and create a "pull request" (a request for a code review) 1. Your automated tests will be run by a build server. 1. 2+ programmers will review your code and will reject it or merge it. 1. A tester and/or the PO will test it. Your ticket will be marked complete. Some teams automate this step. #### Weekly grooming meeting "Grooming" meeting is where we add context to existing tickets in the main backlog: more detailed specifications, testing steps, estimation by vote. The PO is invited, but cannot vote on estimations. This meeting is not about schedule or prioritization. 1 hour. #### Once per sprint meetings Every 2 weeks we get together and discuss how the last 2 weeks went; what went well, what didn't. Then we make a TODO list of ways to improve and we start the next sprint. 1 hour. A day or two before the end, we also have a planning meeting for the next sprint, with the PO. 1+ hour. EDITS: many.,;/1
train,;/That varies and depends on the company\project, is this a 15 person startup? or a 100K+ person company. I work for a big company, projects are super long. and there are times when I can read code and documentation for weeks only to add 2 lines of code to the code base. but when I implement something new I would say that coding is the easy part after you understood what you need to do and how to do it.,;/0
train,;/I think the biggest issue is just how many people are working in parallel on a project. And well, that they are usually never really done. You often have to maintain a program and make minor changes years after it is released.,;/1
train,;/It depends a lot on the job. In a consulting company you'll find that things are probably more similar to university, with much more structured projects that have a start and finish. As far as complexity, it really depends on the project. Most of the work I've encountered in consulting usually involves building some web app that has a whole bunch of business rules in it, but doesn't extend to the complexity of having to do any huge amount of engineering for scale since usually that bespoke app will only be used by an internal department within the client's company. Sometimes you get some user-facing app build that's more exciting because it has more of an emphasis on UI, UX and scale. In product companies, you don't really have the same concept of projects. You just have these long running products and each sprint you'll just pick up feature and bug tickets to work on. Occasionally you'll have mini projects related to that product like building out a new set of related features, but they're much less structured in my experience because you have a lot more freedom in product companies to do R&D and figuring out what the best way to do things is without having clients breathing down your neck. Edit: The one thing that's most different compared to university is the level of polish. You are usually expected to deliver something that's very reliable and doesn't just fall apart all the time.,;/1
train,;/ok this is a pretty loaded. question, because it very much depends on what type of programming you do (web, mobile, middleware, games, iOt etc.) and more importantly what company you work for is it a large corporation or a start-up or are you a freelancer? Let's start with a typical corporate job, you typically assigned to a team of developers working on an existing software project that fullfills some business need of the company. You will need to work WITH PEOPLE , not just developers , but project managers, business executives.etc. Also large corporations have lots of standards and policies about what software stacks you can use, what applications you can leverage, tons of security policies and restrictions., you won't have root access on the servers, all software installed must go through some getting process or use approved vendor software. You'll have a compliance department that makes sure your code isn't violating some.corporate standard or legal regulation. Finally you'll have period code audit's, most if it is done automatically via software. Most projects can be ongoing for years , especially if the project is a software as a service for the company. in smaller start ups you typically are more on your own and have less constraints on what technologies to use, and how to implement the business requirements. Also its likely more of a chaotic development environment with constantly changing software requirements and higher intensity environment. You'll likely be working more closely with the founders and may have to meet many unrealistic deadlines to get your "software to market" or have it ready for an upcoming trade show. While it can be fun and stressful at the same time, there's no guarantee it will last, startups are notorious for fizzling out. You also need to learn how work and communicate with other developers. So yeah basically the Tv sitcom *Silicon Valley* minus all the comedic references. at the end of the day software development is like most white collar professions, working and interacting with people is often times more important than being a great code.monkey. Also in larger places realize most non techies aren't enamored with coding and to them it's just a means to an end.,;/1
train,;/You’ll work on a team. You take on a “story”, aka a requirement, and you work on that for a week or two or maybe longer. It adds just one small feature to the project and you do it again in the next cycle. You won’t be spinning up a new project from scratch every other week.,;/1
train,;/But like what's the average "scope" of a program in the work world? For instance an average assignment in my current Java data structures and algorithms course will usually entail taking input from a text file or from the user via scanner, doing stuff with the data (sorting, creating objects, doing things with those objects, etc) then printing to console or to an output file and a project may consist of 3-7 class files depending on the depth of the assignment. We are usually allowed to assume that the files and user inputs will be in the correct format, with bonus points on stuff for adding in code to handle incorrect formats via printing error messages and skipping error lines or try catching stuff, etc So is career programming usually done simultaneously by dozens or hundreds of people a la Google docs writing on steroids and could have anywhere from tens to hundreds of class files and filled with loads of code to check for and handle invalid inputs and outputs? Are corporate IDEs "shared" like Google docs so that multiple people can work on and edit things at the same time, or is like "Jim, you work on ClassNameAlphaOmega and Bob, you work on ClassNameBetaPhi" and all the files are on a network drive? What happens if you try to compile and run some tests on your code if it relies on someone else's code that they're working on currently?,;/0
train,;/Yes programming is done simultaneously by many people, but not by sharing an IDE google-docs style. Instead people use a version control system. The most common one at the moment is "git" ([https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)) but there are others which are still in use in some places (SVN, mercurial, etc),;/1
train,;/To build on the git answer regarding a tree-structure of code diffs for source control... Your Java assignment sounds like roughly the size of a new ticket of work that you might need to build in an existing codebase. In contrast to your assignment, the exact nature of the inputs may be only approximately known, the exact way to handle the unknown kinds of inputs is not at all known, the inputs may need to change in unexpected ways next month and you're going to want to be able to easily adapt your work to handle the change, and the choices that you make for how to handle those approximate inputs will have downstream effects (because your outputs are somebody else's inputs).,;/1
train,;/I have videos of non English speaking people cooking street food on in the background. If they speak English it just distracts me.,;/1
train,;/If I’m doing mindless copy/paste typing type stuff that just needs doing with little or no thought then music helps the task pass quicker. If I actually need to think about something then the silence and zero distractions are the best option for me.,;/1
train,;/music or pod cast... silence is deafening,;/1
train,;/I can only listen to music at the same time if there are no lyrics. I play a lot of aphex twin or brian eno.,;/1
train,;/Lyric-less music for me. Trying to think about coding logic while having someone saying things in my ear doesn't work. I can't tune out the voice. Go for Synthwave for the extra cool bonus hacker level up style points. And definitely wear sunglasses and a leather coat while sitting at your desk ( /s, but I was serious about the synthwave part),;/1
train,;/Video game soundtracks!!! Videogame music is specifically composed to be pleasant to listen to while not being distracting. I find it makes for the perfect background music while coding. My all-time favorite soundtrack is a really simple piano score to the videogame Splice by a small indie studio called Cipher Prime, my playcount on it is well over 1000, and on one of the tracks it's over 2000 because one time I had it on loop(1) for several days without realizing lol. Some other games I like a lot are Stellaris, Starcraft II, Final Fantasy X, God of War, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and Katana ZERO. The last one is significantly more upbeat/intense than the first ones. I would definitely suggest trying this genre in general if you like the idea of listening to music while coding but have never been able to maintain concentration!,;/1

train,;/I'm Black, and it's not even worth discussing. There's large systemic issues with our current structure of organizations, that have nothing to with how we name our git branches.

It's also not even a Black and White issue, it's really an issue that legislation prevents this. You literally need to be a registered millionaire to take a serious stake in a company, which I don't think many SWEs understand, otherwise, they would stop what they're doing and lobby government to remove these laws. I seriously don't care about git branch names. I care about having a diverse set of companies, ran by a diverse set of people, because if you notice something with our economy, it's not at all antifragile. We just have the same stuff funded by the same people, operating in the same exact way by trying to copy Google in an age where Google will never be replicated again, and we wonder why we have such large startup failure rates.

It's much preferable to the inverse, where you throw language features at a problem while ignoring a simpler implementation. For a mechanical analogy, it's like using a spanner to remove a wheel because you can't find the proper socket. You'll feel a bit dumb when someone shows you how to do it easier, but you're still better off than the guy who brought out an angle grinder instead.,;/1

Then by chance a few weeks later, I read something off topic to this where someone mentioned reliability issues with FSW and how it's not 100% reliable. Then I went back during a refactoring session and rewrote my class that did the same thing only using a timer instead of relying on system events like how FSW works,;/1
train,;/hm, doing research before dev time is an interesting idea. i usually try to mentally map out the path i need to take (when working on an existing project, when buildign from scratch there's a whole design phase that would cover this). &#x200B; what do you usually do in the research to make sure you're aware of everything? &#x200B; the problem is i dont realize i need a particular implementation until i run up against some sort of error.,;/1

train,;/When people approach a big language like C++ with fear instead of curiosity the most likely result is that a lot of people would hate the language. Also, the part that C++ is heavily criticized by big personalities like Linus Torvalds makes a lot of people cargo cult around it, instead of learning the reasons why. Some of the critics are old, some are based in misconceptions about C++ like "C++ is a weird mess. My new language would increase productivity 50 to 80% over it" well yes, but only if your problem is in the same set of the new language targets. And that part of "**My** new language", C++ is not made by one person anymore, C++ doesn't serve the interest of a single person or a single company but instead a large and diverse group of developers in all kind of industries. A single person can't design a language for the same user group as C++ anymore (and also ISO standardization is a big plus in some industries). The story of C++ is interesting because *in spite of* everything against it, it is still one of the most successful languages. A lot of big personalities trash talk about C++, even big companies like sun and ibm did their part to trash talk about C++ explicitly, some universities care a lot about what ""the industry" says and listened to them making professors and new students hate the language as well, and even C++ didn't have a big financial investment. So, I think is controversial because of fear and disinformation. ["C++ is there because we can build good systems for people" - Bjarne](https://youtu.be/_wzc7a3McOs?t=3354),;/1
train,;/Google: Did you mean “How to start war in r/AskProgramming”?,;/2
train,;/The answer is C++ has a wide group of programmers who are aware of it and all of them have very different preferred styles of programming an unconscious biases because of it. If you pardon me I'm going to talk in the language of this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZyvIHYn2zk) on the perverts guide to programming languages. So C was, in the beginning, a language that was primarily chosen for its productivity it was a more productive assembler and thus the programmers who chose it were mostly psychopathic not really interested in rules but mostly just interested in getting the job done. C doesn't have some kind of coherent mental model. C++ is a language that came along to try to add abstractions to C in order to make it easier to express ideas.C++ is a hysterical fork of C. Philosophically, this is more to like if python was implemented on top of PHP. Afterward, C changed because languages became more friendly in general and the crowd around C became more interested in proving they could deal with the lack of expressiveness and handholding in C. In the language of the perverts guide, C became masochistic. C++ has due to its long history lots more ceremony and tasks that don't appear in say python and ruby and thus attracts lots of obsessional programmers. So, yea C++ is a hysterical fork of a masochistic language that used to be psychopathic and itself is more obsessional because of the march of time. All these 4 groups of people fight about C++. The psychopaths find the focus on abstraction pointless. The masochists can't show how disciplined they are by using new abstractions so they don't like them. The obsessives are focused on the minutiae of the language to the annoyance of everyone and the hysterical are busy making a statically typed python. &#x200B; Edit: Woot! Thanks for the gold kind stranger. Hang Loose!,;/1
train,;/C++ is not the only language that is regularly shit on by developers. JavaScript is another example. What do these languages have in common? * They are or were widely used in industry * They provide many ways to write bad code.,;/1
train,;/First of all, some context for those quotes. The Torvalds quote is like 20 years old, when C++ was a much worse language than it is now. Torvalds has even softened towards C++ in recent years. I doubt he'd say something like that today. Jonathan Blow is frankly talking out of his ass. C++ is the industry standard for game development for a reason. And he has no metrics at all to back up his claim. In fact, his language isn't even publicly available yet. However, C++ is a weird mess. It's a massive language, backwards compatible with C for the most part, and with older versions of itself. For this reason you see lots of weird edge cases and duplication of features that you don't have in other languages. Some of the complexity of C++ is unavoidable though. Things like having no garbage collector. For the domains that use C++, where things being performat and real-time are important, a garbage collector is a non-starter. So you basically have to deal with the memory yourself, which seems like added complexity to people not working in those kinds of domains. A lot of people also don't learn C++ very well, and end up hating it because of this. For example, in the C++ class I used to TA, the profs would tell kids to just use `new` and `delete` everywhere, when in reality you should be stack-allocating most stuff. So the kids are getting all these errors about invalid pointers when they shouldn't have even been dealing with pointers in the first. Also, I'd take things your profs say with a grain of salt. They likely haven't coded in 10+ years at least, and professors generally aren't very pragmatic people. There's a reason why C++ is very widespread despite all its flaws.,;/1
train,;/To be fair to Torvalds, he said those things some 20 years ago. He's not nearly as critical of C++ anymore as he once was.,;/2
train,;/It's important to note that they have the second problem for very different reasons. For C++ it's because the committee has literally tacked on every programming language feature they've ever heard of leading to the language becoming incoherent. There's a difference between having a language be unopinionated and having it try to include everything and having every codebase and every programmer's knowledge be inconsistent. Dr. Stroustrup himself has written that there is a smaller, cleaner language inside of C++ waiting to get out or something similar. Frankly it just needs to be replaced by a leaner language that provides just some basic abstractions over C. If D hadn't failed due to its mandatory garbage collector, it could've been that language. On the JavaScript side I think the problem lies heavily in automatic type conversions not always behaving as would be expected as well as equivalence not behaving as expected. The simple solution there is just to make all type conversions explicit(i.e. by typecasting) and not trying to compare unlike types. In any case, JavaScript may as well be a case study in how not to design a dynamic type system. And its heavy usage in industry was only because until relatively recently there was no alternative.,;/1
train,;/I have to wonder if people who criticize memory management in C++ are unfamiliar with the smart pointer features in the newer standards. I worked on a project that switched to smart pointers and it all but eliminated memory management bugs like dangling pointer access and memory leaks. What's really impressive about it to me is that C++ accomplished this: 1. With no garbage collector overhead 2. Really, with no overhead at all (unique_ptr) or very, very little overhead (shared_ptr) 3. With very clear semantics about when an object will be destroyed and its resources freed. This is a problem that plagues garbage collection languages,;/1
train,;/It's crazy the range of programming style you can have with C++. You can be in a file one minute and looks basically like it's C99 with overloading. Then you come across some polymorphic mess with virtual functions coming out the wazzoo and auto's everywhere. When there is such a wide range of styles people are going to hate it for exactly that reason.,;/1
train,;/That and the attempts to add closures and std::function and trying to be object oriented, and functional, and procedural and work at high at low levels of abstraction all at once. And the other thing is, it's fine to have those features if they're presented in a consistent manner but no C++ has to make 5 things that are radically different all have weirdly similar syntax so that: 1. You can't remember all the features and there's no intuitive way to figure them out from what you do remember. 2. If you type something even slightly wrong the compiler may give you an incorrect error because it assumes you're trying to do something other than what you actually are. (I'll admit compilers have gotten a lot better of late. Shout-out to Clang++.) But other than its inconsistency, I like C++. For someone who knows how to use it, it gives you the power to do whatever you want however you want to. It was my first real programming language and the one I know best at this point. It will always hold a special place in my heart.,;/1
train,;/Process is great. It helps you coordinate and maximize output. Minimizes waste and rework. Great! But many, many people I have met have more of an obsession with the process itself, rather than with the results it produces. This leads to perverse incentives and weird behavior. Its incredibly common on project managers, because process is their only point of control - so they try to optimize process instead of outputs.,;/1
train,;/A lot of famous companies used Scrum in the 2000s/early 10s and then a lot of people started thinking that if they implement Scrum/Agile in their companies, success would magically appear. IIRC Spotify posted about their scrum routine and suddenly a lot of companies started copying, including using "Squad" to define teams. Not only that but a lot of managers started using the Scrum in order to get more control over the development process, disregarding agile values to their benefit. Agile lost its meaning over time, it was to programmers get more control over the process and deliver what brought value to clients and now companies use this to their gains. Ask how many people here had to create a lot of features not because their clients asked, but because their marketing team really wanted. Or if the opinion of the clients on the software is more valuable than the CEO. Honestly, i know about agile but i always know that in each company i will have to adapt myself to their style of managment, even if they call Agile or whatever is the hype of the moment,;/1
train,;/Welcome to corporate life where buzzwords are king. There were sigma six and parrots and all other shit before scrum. There will be all sorts of other dumb shit throughout your career. When the salesman sell the C suite on something...,;/1
train,;/>And the thing is, it's not that complicated. In fact, it's pretty simple. If you are seeing this, you are going to go far in your career :) The thing is, even with CS and the higher salaries, its full of suckers and people who just "check of boxes" in doing things without thought or question on whether or not its right or correct. Scrum got sold to companies as a great way of [insert business jargon here], so now its a thing that everyone parrots, and people are scared to go against the grain.,;/1
train,;/The way that I see is that we have the ppl that, indeed, do the things and the ones who like to pressure and control the workers. That's why agile methods are a thing, every decade some small change is made and names are changed, but what do they look for? The best quality in the small amount of time and resources. So yes, the industry is quite obsessed with any agile methods and Scrum is the hype.,;/1
train,;/It's still relatively new. My company only officially started agile 3 years ago, even though there were grassroots teams for a few years before that. Companies spend a lot of time making sure something isn't a fad before adopting it. It took a long time to trust this would work in other contexts than a startup-style environment. The vast majority of working developers did not learn agile in school. Companies are accustomed to providing training in that case, and somewhat unfortunately, consultants drive a demand that often goes a little too far because it helps management feel better. If you had worked pre-agile, you would know it's not intuitive for a company to work this way. They very much tend to centralized control and big design up front, with long release cycles. It's a *very* different way of working. Developers took to agile relatively naturally. Bringing the rest of the company along is an ongoing struggle. Even though there are some scrum purists, agile in general is intended to be adapted. Scrum should be thought of as guidelines to get you started. Guidelines that you discard only with very careful consideration, but still mere guidelines. In my mind, the only required parts of agile is small iterations with fast feedback, and some sort of continual evaluation and evolution of the process. If everyone was doing agile identically, they wouldn't really be doing agile. Variation is an expected part of the process, even among different teams in the same company. Along those lines, if parts of it feel "religious" and like they aren't really providing any value, you should definitely bring that up in retrospectives.,;/1
train,;/Scrum addressed a well-nigh universal observation that imposed dates and workloads didn’t work. Scrum gave dev teams direct control over workload, and in exchange, management got better estimated delivery dates. This worked fantastic in the early days, when enthusiastic early adopters were willing to _surrender_ that control to their dev teams. After a while, my observation has been that later adopters want to cash in on the hot “new” thing, but are unwilling to give their developers any democratic control of the process. I’ve done “scrum” for 20 years; but I’ve only ever done _scrum_ once. When managers today say “scrum” (or hell, even “agile”) what they really mean is, “I don’t want to write a PRD, SRD, or even a roadmap. And I want to throw stuff at the developers on a whim and have them hop to, because we’re _agile_.” Every time I join a new scrum team, it’s like a little heartbreak.,;/1
train,;/And they don't realize that some processes are simply not suitable for scrum and hope that scrumming hard enough will solve all their problems. Bad example 1: an engineering shop (like, the mechanical type) wanted to implement scrum because agile and now they have to weirdly chop up their stories because "waiting six weeks for the shop to manufacture that one part" doesn't really fit in scrum. Bad example 2: a project in my company who's modus operandi is basically chaos, since they have to juggle 20 deadlines at once. They tried to switch to scrum and now they "abort" their sprints all the time and groom for hours because some manager shifted all priorities. This project is screwed anyway, but they're trying their best to at least let it go down with a proper scrum board.,;/2
train,;/"Blockchain!" &#x200B; Yeah people will get used to this. You work in the field for a decade and you realize the only real process is "Coffee + Salary = Code".,;/1

train,;/> Sorry for the off-the-wall question. I think that fits perfectly within the scope of this subreddit. Plus, I'm sure the people here love something other than "why doesn't my code work" and "what language should I choose for this project?" It's fun to get programming-related questions from other contexts!,;/1
train,;/They have figured out English, so given that I'm going to say sure. Packets have lots of repetition, especially in the header, so I'm going to say our alien sock hoppers are up for the challenge.,;/1
train,;/I'm more optimistic than some of the others. I think it would be pretty straightforward to pick apart enough of a TCP connection to have some idea what's going on. How exactly they get the stream will make a difference. If they pick up wifi signals from an orbiting human spaceship, I think that would be impossible. The signaling rate is very high to try to pick anything out with 50's electronics, and there is a lot of channel hopping RF weirdness to something like WIFI. They might detect a small amount of static noise, but they wouldn't be able to identify a signal. But assuming they had a log of 1's and 0's and didn't have to pick apart the physical layer, they'd probably be able to get something out of it. Since the premise is whether aliens can figure out TCP, and not whether they can figure out Wifi (or Ethernet)... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_segment_structure shows the header format. The source and destination port are constant for a single transaction, so you don't need to understand it deeply if you've already got a single TCP conversation to examine. The binary encoding is straightforward, and if they have a lot of examples to dig through, they'd probably figure out that dest port = 80 is unencrypted because the payloads have patterns, and dest port = 443 is encrypted because of basic frequency analysis. That would suggest they should focus their efforts on stuff where the conversation starts with the second 16 bits having that value. Things like the exact checksum algorithm -- I'd guess their top mathematicians could figure that out, but it's not necessary for reading the stream. You only need that for sending data that is valid, or validating possibly corrupt data. For general reverse engineering, you can skip it. The SYN ACK SYNACK pattern is 100% consistent when creating a connection, and had obvious bits set, so that part would be pretty straightforward to figure out. Especially if you've got some ability to steal a piece of human gear and cause it to try to connect to things on command to generate arbitrary amounts of test data. The general length of the headers vs. the payload would also be pretty easy to figure out if you've got enough example packets to study. When downloading plain text, the values after the header range are always constrained to a certain range of valid/normal printable ASCII characters. And you could differentiate probably text downloads from larger binary downloads based on the length of the TCP conversation - an MP4 file download will be many more packets, and with 1950's computers being used for the analysis, you'd work on short complete streams first. Figuring out that we use 8 bits as the basic unit of data transmission would probably be a bit of a guess at first. There's no reason it has to be true. But it's a fairly small number, a convenient power of two, etc. So it makes sense that they'd figure out byte alignment fairly early after trying 5/6/7/9 bit alignments for interpreting the data and finding that conversation bit length % 8 is always 0. Again, that depends on having multiple examples to look at because any given stream could have an even number of bytes if you tried to assume it had 5 bit bytes. Since I think you could get a decent estimate for the boundary of the header vs the payload when downloading plaintext, it's probably that they could figure out the data offset field from those streams, and then use that to pull payloads out of non-ascii downloads as well. So, a few fields would be WTF's. HTTPS would be a lost cause. Figuring out what is in an MP4 file would exceed their compute capacity. But the bare minimum of TCP traffic analysis is probably possible. They could probably do stuff like read email on port 25 if they had a way to capture the packets. Once they know it is text, and they know English already, figuring out enough ASCII to read most plain text is a simple Caesar cipher. Kids could almost figure out that for fun. It helps if they know that the name of their own planet is likely to be in the text, or some stuff like that that can be helpful for guessing ASCII values. They might well get some of ASCII wrong. If the corpus they use for reverse engineering is all written by a jackass who constantly types IN ALL CAPS! Or ends every! sentence! with an exclamation Point! They might mix up . and ! or mix up upper case and lower case. But they'd plausibly be able to get far enough to get the gist of it. If saving their alien planet depends on connecting to human hardware and speaking the full protocol, rather than merely being able to get some useful information out of it, you need to master sequence numbers and checksums and acks. That's harder. Not necessarily impossible, but sort of a EUREKA moment in the bath tub while smoking a pipe for some parts of it. I can easily believe them never getting it after years of work. I can also believe the Bletchly park team that figured out Enigma in the 40's looking over some papers for five minutes and spotting patterns immediately. But even the crazy geniuses that cracked Enigma had several years to build custom hardware at the very limits of the technology at the time. It wasn't just one all-nighter.,;/1
train,;/Not impossible but profoundly difficult. A big part of deciphering unknown data is having some guess as to what to look for. Assuming the payload was ASCII character data for English text the aliens might eventually figure out how a byte corresponds to a letter, but even that would be difficult because the first letter of the English alphabet 'A' is 01000001. An alien would eventually recognize that 0100 is some sort of prefix for letters, but it would be a stumbling block. There's also a lot of data in the header of a TCP/IP packet. A lot of that header doesn't make much sense out of context. If you have no concept of an IPv6 address then you've just got a couple long, random sequences with no idea how long the sequences are. Think about how long it took to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. People stared and hypothesized for hundreds of years about what a bird, an eye, and maybe a snake meant, and that's with advanced knowledge of what a bird, an eye, and a snake are. They had plenty of context clues as well like where the hieroglyphs were found. Real understanding didn't come about until a key, the Rosetta stone, was found. Maybe that could be a plot point for your story?,;/1
train,;/Assuming there's no encryption, they could at the very least extract the plaintext data from our messages, but they wouldn't even have an ASCII table, so they'd have to reverse engineer a lot more than just the transport layer protocols.,;/1

train,;/A lot of people blame SEO but over the last few years google have started implementing some algorithm that tries to guess user intent. For example, when you search `ant` it tries to guess if you are searching for the animal or apache ant. They also added horrible auto-exclude words feature that again is trying to guess your intent. So you add quotes, hopefully trying to force the search into finding appropriate results but it This fails miserably weirdos like us know what we're searching for. Google has gotten better at predicting user intent for the majority of searches. But for more technical and precise queries it fails. It is also forgetting the old web: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19604135 I miss the google of old.,;/1
train,;/Yeah, search results in general have gotten worse over the past few years as more people learn how to use SEO to promote their shitty content.

It's just one bad decision after another and unfortunately we were left to reap what was sown.

train,;/There's a chance they may not care about the software being cracked (for example, they rely on B2B deals instead of selling it directly to regular consumers). This would mean they don't lose anything/much by people cracking their software and may gain more by suing you for "damages".,;/1
train,;/maybe you could sell some of those serial numbers to pay for the lawyer you're going to need,;/1
train,;/Firstly, cracking a software regardless of your intentions might be illegal. This depends on the company rules of bug bounties some just does allow it at all.

train,;/I don't really think it's as big a deal as others are making it. I've had interns on my teams who were just starting out. This was their first time using the language we use and first time writing real code for a real company. They did fine and learned a lot. We don't expect an intern to come in and start contributing right away. It's a learning experience for them. I would probably still correct it if I were you, but if I were the company you sent it to and you sent me the correction, I'd think it's not a big deal and continue with the process anyway. The programming language is not what I'm looking for in an intern. I'm looking for the willingness and ability to learn as well as basic programming concepts.,;/1
train,;/Presumably this is not the only language on your resume? I would fix your resume and if (when) it comes up during an interview, be prepared to address it then. "I've done some self study on C++, but I'm a lot more comfortable with C#" Back in my school days the there was a whole department dedicated to getting students internships. You probably have a contact there, so ask them!,;/1
train,;/I def don't agree with the rest of theses comments. Don't send a correction, that just makes you look bad. This is an internship. They hardly expect you to know anything. Just study the basics of C++ and pointers and you'll be fine. Any syntax you run into on the job that you don't know, you can just Google it. No big deal tbh,;/1
train,;/I see most of these comments are on the extreme ends - either you're screwed or it's a non-issue. Personally, I'd say it's in-between (though I wouldn't call the first case "screwed"). If you applied for positions for C# development, then it's possible that since you don't have C# on your resume, you get passed over in favor of a candidate that does, all else being equal. If you applied for positions for C++ development, then it's possible that you get selected in favor of a candidate that doesn't have C++ listed, all else being equal, and you either learn C++ well enough to succeed or you struggle and you don't get invited to a second internship or full time position and get put on the do-not-rehire list of the company. Neither case is the end of the world unless you applied for an internship associated with your dream job. I personally wouldn't worry about sending corrections in now, but correct it and maybe mention it should you get an interview. As someone who has dealt with people whom have lied on their resumes, I wouldn't be too happy to have you tell me you know C++ and then be completely unfamiliar with the basics of C++ compared to C# or even at least the basics of pointers. But as others have said, for an internship I would't necessarily care that you know the language so if you tell me during an interview that you accidentally listed C++ instead of C#, I probably would thank you for clarifying that and proceed without giving it much of a thought. It would only really come down to if everything else points to you and someone else both seemingly being equal in all regards but the other candidate knows the language and you don't (which wouldn't be any different than if you had put C# instead of C++ on the resume in the first place). But if you tell me you know C++ and then your performance shows you don't, that's not going to go over well. Consider, though, that the worst case for an internship would again be simply we wouldn't invite you back.,;/1

Anyone who does dismiss you for asking "stupid" questions isn't the kind of person who deserves your headspace. Ask questions, it's the best way to learn and advance. If you can, maybe see if someone in your company can mentor you, or maybe a friend?,;/1
train,;/I’m a female dev and I’ve been in your exact situation, however it was the fear of failure that forced me to ask questions. I was promoted from helpdesk to design & dev because I showed an aptitude for coding. I had no qualifications and it was simply up to me to learn on the job- however it was up to my male colleagues to train me. Some of them were nasty and patronising, others were helpful and supportive. It is hard and scary at first, but just start asking - you’ll find those who are happy to help and avoid those who are not. 7 years later I’m now Lead Dev at a small agency. However I still prefix my questions to anyone with ‘I’m probably being thick’ or ‘stupid question alert...’. A little self-deprecation goes a long way! Also be grateful - don’t forget to say thanks. Despite the bad experiences I’m still grateful to those colleagues - nice and nasty - who showed he how to do stuff. Good luck!!!,;/1
train,;/Woman to woman, you have to be okay with asking questions. If you're still young in this field, the only thing separating you and all the other noobs will be your ability to communicate and learn. Your fear of looking stupid is only going to stunt your growth. If you ask someone a question and they treat you like you're stupid because of it, that person is an asshole and you should limit your interactions with them.,;/1
train,;/Stop seeing gender at work. Keto telling yourself that with enough determination you will succeed, because that's the truth. You should mostly see people who will also not care about gender at work. Some people will be assholes though. Try not to take it personally. Also we all get the impostor syndrome when we join a new team, can't contribute yet, have a ton of questions and take up everyone's time. It's normal to suck the first few weeks or months, and it's normal to feel very bad about it. I wish you all the best. With you joining the ranks maybe the myth that women don't code will evaporate slightly sooner and there will be far more good software developers around.,;/1
train,;/We need you. It’s male dominated because people are afraid to join the industry. We are missing out on amazing talent because of this. And women are missing out on a fun and fulfilling career. I’m 41, a guy, and I have been in the job for 22 years. I am not confident in my abilities, but I crack on, and so should you.,;/1
train,;/Regardless of gender, when someone asks me a question at work I typically view them as more capable than I did prior to the encounter — not less. Asking good questions shows me you understand the problem and to what extent you understand the problem. It highlights the communication or knowledge gaps that led to the problem, and I usually walk away from the conversation knowing more myself. As to the fear that you may appear incompetent due to your gender, it’s just like the old saying:“Those who mind don’t matter; those who matter don’t mind”. If you find yourself under additional scrutiny because of your gender, it’s more likely a sign of a toxic culture than indicative of any personal flaw you have.,;/1
train,;/To add to this when you have a question, write it as if you were writing am email. "I want to do X, I tried abc and I expected it to do 321… but it gave me 123… why?" Usually actually writing out your thought process will lead you to the follow up question(s) that you can answer yourself, lead you to more questions to answer, or sharpen your understanding to a point where you're asking a precise question that shows you understand all the fundamentals. If you do this you won't feel dumb.,;/1
train,;/I was given one piece of great advice by my boss at my previous job (paraphrasing because I don’t remember the exact wording): don’t sell yourself short by saying something like “stupid question alert”. Your good at what you do, you’re smart, and you’ve proven yourself. You’re only hurting yourself and making other people doubt you when there is no reason for them to do so.,;/1
train,;/Just wanted to say well done to you, we rarely see people like yourself anymore!,;/2
train,;/If possible, try to give them the idea that you've already made the choice that you will hire them. Focus on the responsibilities at the job and how they will handle them. For programmers, the most important trait is that they're resourceful. This is something that's hard to test for in an interview, but by focusing more on work situations, you may get a glimpse for how they tackle problems that they encounter. Good programmers will immediately start looking for possible solutions Now there is a chance that this person isn't very resourceful and that they're not very good at coming up with solutions to problems they face. In that case, they will be more nervous when talking about work situations, so if you can't make them comfortable, chances they aren't going to be a good employee,;/1
train,;/Be honest and open. When interviewing avoid "gotcha" questions or academic style "So what's the upper limit on an array?" or something but shoot for open questions that perhaps don't even have a definitive answer, but will encourage the candidate to have a discussion. Ask them the kind of thing you will expect them to face in the job you are hiring for. How would you scale a web app? What do you look for when building a service? Tell me what your ideal average work day is? that kind of thing. I actually encourage this kind of interview for everyone anyway. I want to hire a person who is going to ask questions, and who is willing to discuss problems and solutions and an exam isn't going to tell me that. Be sympathetic to their situation but also give them encouragement by not focussing on it. Just tell them you are sorry to hear they are feeling the pinch and leave it at that. If you focus on it at all they are likely to start thinking it's besmirched their reputation and will negatively impact their chances.,;/1
train,;/As a currently depressed interviewee, I think the best thing you can do to gauge his abilities is just let him talk about his accomplishments at past jobs and give him space to speak. For myselff, when I'm in a depressed state of mind, it can be hard to get outside of a pattern of thinking I'm worthless or unhireable because I don't know everything about tool x specified in the 5th bullet point of the job description or scripting language y. When I sit down and start having to talk about everything I've done at past jobs, I start to realize I've accomplished much more than I think and maybe I'm not completely worthless. I think getting him into this more positive frame of mind and making occasional remarks that make it seem like you're genuinely interested ("tell me about that", or just an encouraging nod) will give you a better chance to see if he would be a good fit for the job or not.,;/1
train,;/I was a severely depressed interviewee while looking for my first job in this field. In one horrible interview I had, I had to first talk to a big picture asshole who made everything seem far above my abilities. Basically made me feel like I was wasting everyone's time. Then I talked to the guy who knew what I would be actually doing, and the job sounded like a great fit. I could have done it. When you are describing the job, know exactly what the applicant would be doing, and talk about the core content of the job so that it sounds manageable. I.e. be the opposite of job adds. You are looking for an ordinary professional to do certain usual thing with ordinary people, not a super genius to do vague etraordernery things while leveraging synergies with your leading team of experts.,;/1
train,;/Agree with everything youre saying but You have to be careful here. Someone who is having a hard time and you give them hope, then pull it away it can be very traumatic for them. I wouldn’t give them the impression that they have the job, but that they have a legitimate chance. We know this person is under stress, but we don’t know how much or what their limit is.,;/1
train,;/>If possible, try to give them the idea that you've already made the choice that you will hire them. But i haven't made the choice. I still need to interview him first. >by focusing more on work situations, you may get a glimpse for how they tackle problems that they encounter This seems like a gold idea, will try this.. Thanks for your inputs! I think i have few problem statements that can help me evaluate on this front..,;/2
train,;/This is terrible advice. Never, ever give anyone the idea that they have been selectedif it isn't true. It is heartbreaking for the applicant if they aren't successful and can lead to claims of inappropriate hiring practices.,;/1
train,;/I think commenter just meant make them *feel* like you have made the decision to make them feel more comfortable. Not actually tell them they are hired.,;/2
train,;/As someone who thought they got a job only to be ghosted that can hurt. I would instead try and reassure them that they were chosen to interview because you think they're qualified and have a good shot at getting the position. This prevents them from feeling like they were lied too and potentially gives them confidence in future interviews as they might feel if interviewer X thinks I'm qualified then I'm qualified.,;/1
train,;/I don't think "C+" was ever a thing? The "++" part of "C++" refers to the "increment by 1" operator of C, so the name can be interpreted as something along the lines of "next after C" or "C plus one". Which makes sense, given that it was made as an extension of C.,;/1
train,;/Why C# and not D♭?,;/0
train,;/Those senior developers lied to me!!!! The prank war is on,;/2
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/Fun fact, C in itself was supposed to be a joke name, as the creator of C was also the creator of the [B programming language](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34054/b-programming-language) about 10 years earlier. Also, [there's a programming language called D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)) that was initially meant to be a replacement for C++ (but ended up turning into its own thing). There are also a bunch of other programming languages with similar names, including A+ (yes, just one +), A.NET, ABC, B, C\*, C--, Ch, C\_0, Lite-C, D, E, F, F#, F\*, G-code, J, J++, J#, K, M4, M#, P, P4, P'', Q, Q#, R, R++, S, S2, s3, T, Z notation, and Z++. ([here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) a link to the source) So honestly C+ wouldn't be unusual for programming language naming conventions. &#x200B; Edit: Then if you want to learn about *really* obscure languages with really weird names, you can check out [EsoLangs](https://esolangs.org). My personal favorite is [ASCII Dots](https://esolangs.org/wiki/AsciiDots).

train,;/Time complexity. Using a nested loop scares me now,;/1
train,;/The feeling of knowing everything day one after graduation.. I jest, being a self taught 10 years in I am keen to hear what people have to say.,;/1
train,;/I had a couple of courses during university, but my degrees are actually in maths and physics. Still, there are some topics that I'm very happy to have learned about and see self-taught programmers struggling with: \- Design Patterns. Specifically Inversion of Control, Adaptor, Observer, Null Object, Singleton \- Broad base of different languages with different programming paradigms, e. g. learning about declarative programming from Prolog gave me a lot better understanding of what is possible with abstractions \- Some data structures (e. g. hashes vs. lists) \- Logical operators and how they behave (even simple things like "not (a and b) = not a or not b"),;/1
train,;/I graduated over a decade ago and in general the main things it seems self taught programmers have no clue about are: * Automata / state machines * Compiler theory (a lot of the above) * A lot of esoteric data structures and algorithms * Simple predicate logic * Digital circuit design / system design / CPU design * Operating system concepts Everyone seems to know "how to program" and time complexity, but know the above concepts allows you to program well. E.g. 6 months ago I was working with a customer integrating to our device, and they'd sent me their code to help out with. I happened to look at an unrelated part that dealt with their own API and it was hideous. Had they understood what a finite state machine was they'd have massively reduced the number of lines in that piece of code and it wouldn't be some horrendous callback hell.,;/1
train,;/As a self-taught programmer, I remember one time I was talking to a friend who had a PhD-abd in CS, and describing this sorting algorithm I'd made up for myself that had the property of being in linear time under certain circumstances. He listened, and then after said "Oh, you've invented a radix sort". So, two things you can get from a CS degree - familiarity with a LOT of knowledge and insights (and terminology) that you would otherwise spend a lot of your own time perhaps reinventing, and your reinventions will be incomplete compared to the real thing (I didn't invent a generalized radix sort, but a limited one). I don't mean those two things to be an exhaustive list, mind you.,;/1
train,;/Not quite an answer to your question but... I’m a self-taught programmer who started coding at the age of 14. 22 years later, I’m the Software Engineering Manager for my employer. However, I still feel that because I don’t have a degree or more formal education, that I’m “lacking” in a number of areas and I feel that it is this reason alone that I’ve not been considered for a number of other roles in the past. This year I’m undertaking a CS degree to fill this void with a hope to be taken more seriously, should I apply for other roles in future.,;/2

train,;/Does recursion also scare you? o:,;/0
train,;/The imposter syndrome sounds familiar..,;/2
train,;/I'm sorry to hear about your friend. I'm not an expert on AWS because 99% of my experience is in Azure, but I htink your friend had an AWS EC2 instance (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). This is a virtual server running on AWS. He specified the id for that instance in a configuration. This script then connects to that instance, using his credentials, and runs minecraft on it. That is why the IP changes - the instance id remains the same, but every time you ask AWS to give you a server for that instance, it spins up a new one and gives it to you. Beyond that, no real clue - it's open source; maybe post an issue on the repository explaining the situation and one of the people who has contributed to it will take it over? What you would need to do to take it over is create your own AWS account, your own EC2 instance, and get the id / credentials for it and set this script up to run with those.,;/1
train,;/First of all, so sorry to hear about your friend. Your post revealed his name and through his name I saw that he had a very similar path and death as person I went to school with (an ambitious software engineer taken too soon in a kayaking accident). I was frankly pretty shaken up when my classmate passed away, I can only imagine how you're feeling. Fortunately, given the circumstances, it looks like your friend open sourced his project and you can preserve his code by doing something called a 'fork' on Github. This will create a copy of his code that you can continue to modify and update if you or your friends want to. It looks like your friend has already had about 40 other people do the same thing so they could either contribute to the project themselves or keep their own version. It looks like he had 3 other contributors: [https://github.com/trevor-laher/OnDemandMinecraft/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/trevor-laher/OnDemandMinecraft/graphs/contributors) To make your own fork you'll need a Github account (free) and then follow these instructions: [https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) (most of it can be done via the UI) To make changes you'll need to learn a few things or work with someone who knows them including a technology called 'git' and the software language Python. Fortunately, these are really common tools (assuming you aren't familiar with them already). Once you've created your Github account, you can create the fork from here: [https://github.com/trevor-laher/OnDemandMinecraft](https://github.com/trevor-laher/OnDemandMinecraft) What the code appears to do (based on the README) is launch a Minecraft server on AWS automatically after you set up a configuration file (it's technically a Python file), so to actually use it you'll need an AWS account to learn a little bit about what EC2 is and the costs associated with that (they are generally minimal, but be sure to do some research first). This is a link to the pricing for EC2 instances: [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) There's a ton of information on that page, but to take 1 example, if you wanted to use a t3.large server for Minecraft you would pay $0.0832 per hour or about $60/month. I don't know offhand what you need to run Minecraft, that might be overkill. Hopefully that's enough info to get you started. I'm pretty familiar with all the technology he used, if you have any questions please ask. I'd love to help more.,;/1
train,;/I'm sorry to hear about your friend. I'm familiar with AWS and happy to help if I can. Please reach out and we can see how far we can get.,;/1
train,;/I've spent the last 2 days going through this repository to implement the same thing for me and my friends during these quarantine times. I'm very sorry to hear about your friend. It's truly a gift being able to impact people's lives - specially when we are gone. Hopefully you can find some solace with this.,;/2
train,;/So this is open-source code. All you need to do is fork this code by making your own github account, and actually go through the process of running and operating the code yourself. It's likely the existing server will run out of money before you can get AWS to shift it over to you, which they probably won't. Just take the code and maintain it yourself.,;/1
train,;/I'll give it a whirl I'm not the most tech-savvy with this type of stuff. So I am going in blind. AWS I wonder if I can just get his account info and to transfer it to me and to my bank account. I'll probably need to transfer the domain he uses from whichever place he bought it from. I just want to keep this thing alive since he isn't. Thank you very much for the info ill try to see how the people on GitHub could help.,;/1
train,;/Thank you very much. I'll see what I can get from customer support on these websites for URL the AWS and if any other places if Github needs it. If I cant I can get the info from his family but if I need something from them id like to know what I should ask for so i dont waste time. Telling me all this means I can get the info set up. Thank you,;/1
train,;/Thank you! Ive sent some support tickets to the various places and see where i can get. I will gladly take help if things dont work out.,;/2
train,;/If you're in contact with his family, the credentials you need are almost certainly on his computer. Now, it's quite possible that no one can access the computer, but if it is possible then the process would be pretty trivial, as you'd have all the credentials you'd need to prove you ought to be able to claim this server, namely the Access and Secret keys in configuration.py. From there it would be the simple matter downloading the minecraft server files, then setting up your own AWS account, and setting up a new Heroku app, for which the steps are remarkably well detailed in the GitHub repository. I wish you the best of luck, and I'm sorry for your loss.,;/1
train,;/Ok,;/2
train,;/The big ones for me were: * The Pragmatic Programmer * Design Patterns * Code Complete,;/1
train,;/Effective Java by Joshua Bloch. The ideas in that book extend far beyond Java and even object oriented programming in many cases. Much of the advice centers around making the interfaces between components of your program as simple and well documented as possible. With simpler interfaces, tests are easier to write, tasks are easier to split off to different people, refactoring causes fewer heisenbugs, and more.,;/1
train,;/Clean code, by uncle Bob, only book you really need,;/1
train,;/Stack Overflow.,;/1
train,;/Introduction to Algoritms, by Cormen,;/1
train,;/Read other people’s code.,;/2
train,;/Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. The book gives a nice visual overview and a great explanation of important algorithms.,;/1
train,;/This is such a good book, i recommend it to everyone. I've hardly written any Java in my career but this book was still invaluable.,;/2
train,;/Be careful with this one, lots of good but also a lot of very Java specific or OOP specific patterns. Some of it is also a bit dated. Would still recommend, but having just read it recently (after 6-7 years professional experience) I was expecting something magical and it’s not quite that.,;/1
train,;/https://images.app.goo.gl/gwUJBuYoyshL2Xfs8,;/3
train,;/Agree. Even if you can come up with a solution to a problem quickly, that doesn't mean that it is a good solution (maintainable, easy to read, testable).,;/1
train,;/Competitive programming helps develop an ability to recognize which algorithms are able to solve the problem at hand, and to be able to implement them in a time efficient manner (along with other similar "low-level" stuff). Understanding concepts like pros/cons of various data structures, and time complexity of various algorithms, etc, certainly points towards someone being a "good" programmer. But, the problems depicted by competitive programming challenges do stray a bit away from things you might encounter in the "real world", at your standard programming gig. The main aspects of a "good" programmer are to be able to produce something that solves the problem at hand, quickly. And in the real world, this generally means knowing how to use various libraries together to accomplish more complex tasks quickly. No employer is going to want you to spend a week perfecting some home-brewed implementation of functionality that is readily available from open sourced code. By maintaining such a "low-level" focus, like competitive programming teaches, I feel like it's easy to overwork solutions to problems that could much more quickly and easily be accomplished by using some library, or copy/pasting from stackoverflow, allowing you to more forward with other, likely more important, aspects of the project. I guess it depends on the definition of a "good" programmer. Is it someone who knows the ins-and-outs of the language, and has a good "fundamental" understanding of programming, or is it someone who can produce the most value for the company in a short amount of time by being able to piece together various existing components to do more complex things.,;/1
train,;/I don't get this competitive programming craze, been programming for 15 years, but that's just me.,;/2
train,;/What does one mean by "good at programming" exactly?,;/0
train,;/It's not a good indicator. Sometimes good design takes time, you could throw together some bullshit that functions but is completely unmaintainable but that doesn't make it better than someone's code that is easy to use and readable but might take a bit more time to develop.,;/1
train,;/those last 3 points are so much more important than wrote memorization and single-liners. unfortunately competence in algorithms generally is directly related to other programming skills but something like a take home project would show a lot more. you can analyze the testing, solid, dry, documenting, maintainability, etc. it's basically "this is what my PR would look like" and you can glean a lot from that,;/1
train,;/> But, the problems depicted by competitive programming challenges do stray a bit away from things you might encounter in the "real world", at your standard programming gig. A good example of this is when a colleague of mine was working on a filter option for our app. I thought a bitmask would be a great solution and suggested it. At first she disagreed but then took it on and did a FANTASTIC job implementing it. I never had the heart to tell her, but a year later I regretted it all. It was just unnecessary. We didn't use any of the bit utilities she built anywhere else and while it was easy for me to extend, new developers to our team had no idea what was going on.,;/2
train,;/I can see it as a test of mental acuity under pressure, like speed chess. Besides, if there are chili pepper eating contests or chasing rolling cheese down a hill competitions...why not coding ; ),;/1
train,;/Can produce a relatively efficient, easy to read, testable solution to a problem I guess,;/1
train,;/As a bullet chess player I love the comparison. It's a completely different game because while the rules are the same, time plays a much larger part, and you can use strategies you otherwise wouldn't.,;/1
train,;/- `man` is freaking underrated, seems like people rather use SO/websearch (same for documentation) - `redshift` - obv. learn the basic tools such as `dd`/`cat`, `tac`, `uniq`, `sort`, `tr`, `xargs` etc. - learn how to use regex (for `sed`, `grep` etc.); but also learn when *not* to use regex! - `ktrace`, `strace` or whatever else there is depending on the OS - netcat (ie. `nc`) & `curl` - for analysing binaries: `radare2`, `ROPgadget`, `objdump`, `readelf`, `strings`, `ldd`, `file` - switch to Spacemacs ;) - use vim-bindings for your shell & REPLs - use tmux with `\` as prefix (UK layout) - tiling window manager - rebind your keys (I swapped esc & caps, right-shift to switch to last used workspace in XMonad, use PrtSc as modifier for certain combos to have utf8 symbols) - searchcode.com - IRC,;/1
train,;/Tmux.,;/1
train,;/For webdev vsCode is great. es-lint prettier git lense,;/1
train,;/jq - bash json transformer (pretty print, filter fields, validation, etc) home brew - life changer for installing things on OSX (brew install java, now java is installed and fully configured) spectacle - not a dev tool but super convenient for window management on OSX. Move things between monitors, line windows up, etc. zsh - a shell that provides an easy way to add plug-ins (auto completion, etc) and terminal display/coloring. Also I recommend getting comfortable with basic bash and a .bashrc or .zshrc file. Learn to alias functions for common tasks. (For example ssh into all instances of a specific ASG, using AWS cli, jq to parse response and bash to wrap it all up) so then myapp-prod opens a terminal to each instance.,;/1
train,;/Most any linter. Linters are great for keeping your code clean, possibly pointing out bad practices and (if you work with others) keep your code consistent with teammates.,;/1
train,;/GNU Screen or Tmux. Either of these gives you the ability to have multiple comments-line virtual sessions from one terminal window, and quickly switch between them with a key or two. The best part is you can detach from it and reattach. How I use this: I start Screen on my main development server, then create new virtual screens and ssh to other servers that I might be to connect to. When developing I can easily create a new screen and do things like watch log output (sometimes I have dedicated screens for certain logs like web access, web error..), search for something, edit other files... Then I can disconnect at the end of the day and reconnect the next day, picking up where I left off. Oh you can also connect to a single Screen/Tmux session from multiple windows, so it’s easy to see something side-by-side or monitor something. I also use this at home on my Synology, with log file watch on various things, and curl/wget on other sessions so I can start a long download from my phone and disconnect while it’s running. Personally I use Screen mostly, but only because I’m used to the status line (which I enable) and the key commands. I also change the escape keystroke to ctrl-W so it doesn’t interfere with emacs-style text editing key (ctrl-A).,;/1

Don't get me wrong the amount of deep work i do has still taken a hit but at least i managed to contain the damage. Also as a rule of thumb i like to think that 3 hours of deep work a day is actually a good day's worth of work. The rest can be spend on unimportant and/or unurgent tasks,;/1

train,;/All the time, except bio/coffee breaks or stupid meetings. 7-7:30 hours from 8. What about "working longer" - its a very bad, destructive habit in my opinion. Knowing you have fixed time to show yourself teaches you to be efficient, cheating with "I am not happy with my results today, so I'll just spend few more hours" - total opposite, makes you slow and lazy. Also for good work you need to have good rest. Working longer takes that rest away and hurts your next day work results. Of course, sometimes there is a situation where I am forced to stay for longer time (some outage in the evening, for example), but such situations are very rare. In a usual day I have 8 hours to show myself and that is. If I did good, that's good, if I did not - well, I can't be a winner every time, better luck next day. :),;/1

Yet, 54% of those surveyed said the distractions made the working day ‘more bearable.’ https://ercouncil.org/2019/chart-of-the-week-week-8-2019/ Granted that's not limited to just developers.

Its not about the time. If you got something done that day, or got closer to getting something done, you can't really let it get you down. I once spent a week trying to fix a nasty UI issue that was caused by a broken 3rd party library, and I was happy if I even got a different error by the end of the day. Don't work longer.

train,;/You might know that cats don't have [object permanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence), so object oriented programming is completely out the window. As well as global variables must go (or at least allowing functions to modify global varaibles must go). The only things that can change are the things immediately in front of you. Cats don't do anything until absolutely required, this you may call being 'lazy'. This should be reflected in your programming language as [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation). Cats have seven lives. Your programming language should tolerate errors exactly 7 times until it halts. Basically, act like javascript for the first 7 errors and just slap some default value or just ignore that line. One you hit the 8th error, crash over the most inane thing like adding an integer to a float. You could even require semicolons, but only after the first seven non-semicoloned line.

train,;/From work experience with second versions, I would say that much of it comes from massively underestimating the workload and complexity of doing the second version.

Over the years I've been forced to admit that a lot of it makes sense given the deeper structures of the language (NaN is object, not string...note the strictness of your equality operator) or at least you can see why it works that way.

train,;/I always thought the `_` (single underscore) and `__` (double underscore) in python was some aesthetic shit until I figured it was how Python understood private items/properties!

It's only matter of time before it becomes 21st century Perl.,;/1

train,;/The code can't be broken if you don't have any code ;),;/2
train,;/> NaN =/= NaN This REALLY makes sense actually. You wouldn't' want the result of say an overflow to equal the result of dividing by zero. Actually you don't want it to not equal either, but if those two are your options, js definitively makes the right choice here.,;/2
train,;/> like their counterintuitive type equivalencies (NaN =/= NaN, etc) Unlike most other flaws in JavaScript, this one is not the language's fault. JavaScript, like most other languages, uses the computer's underlying hardware to represent floating point numbers and chips implement [IEEE 754 floats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985). That standard specifies that NaN != NaN and your computer's CPU itself implements that directly.,;/2
train,;/It would probably make more sense to regard NaN as a set, with elements for each type of NaN. A code could reasonably want to terminate as soon as it sees any NaN, or maybe try and handle cases where NaN popped up from some numerical issue differently from cases where it resulted from things being undefined.,;/2
train,;/Javascript is not a well designed language (but that can be said about a lot of popular programming languages). Few examples: * variables are global by default * the way objects and "inheritance" work is way different any other language in use (ES6 classes improve things, but they are just a facade on the old system) * how `this` keyword works is pure insanity * many operations that you expect to work do crazy things, like adding two arrays produces a string * some operations are plain missing from the language - comparing two arrays means writing a loop yourself, comparing two objects is something you probably need an external library for * there are not even integers in the language, all numbers are floating-point (that is usually not a problem, but when it starts to be, you are in for a ride) * the ecosystem is quite terrible, installing hundreds of dependencies is considered normal, there are libraries for single line of code However, if you want to learn javascript, go for it, don't let me and other people discourage you. There is a famous quote from the creator of C++: > There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses. and javascript is one of the most popular languages.,;/1
train,;/Personally, I hate that javascript is not strongly typed. If you don't add type to your variables and function arguments and return values, then you're gonna mess up at some point, and/or lose some time trying to figure out some code that would be clearer with types. If you have to use javascript, please consider coding in typescript instead to generate your javascript.,;/1
train,;/I wouldn't say "garbage", but I really, _really_ don't like using JS unless absolutely required. The language syntax isn't the issue (most scripting languages have odd quirks, that's nothing unusual, even if JS has more than most), so much as it is everything else: * Very weak standard library, which results in a lot of stuff falling to community package management, which is heavily fragmented and often very messy * Ecosystem and community take a _very_ "move fast and break everything" mentality to everything. I've seen widespread breakages and flagrant disregard for even the most basic versioning best practices in npm that I've virtually never seen in any other ecosystem. Stuff seems to be almost perpetually broken or about to be broken, no matter how careful you try to be. * npm is a real mess - it's better than it used to be, but even now there's a lot of frustrating and counterintuitive behavior (e.g. lock file isn't actually a lock file at all unless you use a command that doesn't appear to have anything to do with lock files). And as noted, the community is incredibly bad about versioning. * (javascript only): even for scripting languages, I really feel they need to support gradual/optional typing. Obviously TypeScript exists, which is great, but I consider it to be somewhat distinct from javascript as a whole. Etc.,;/1
train,;/I use js / ts daily and love it, but I have to say js is poorly designed. Lot of stuff on the language just seem hacky. Examples: * `this` keyword is an absolute nightmare * classes does not follow the OOP principles as in other languages * Truthness and Falseness is not well defined (0 and empty string are considered false, but empty arrays or maps don't) * NPM is terrible. There are popular packages that are only one line of code and each project downloads hundreds of packages * NPM is not secure * Difference between == and ===, even though I almost never use the double equals operator * Variables are set to undefined by default * Misspelling a variable name does not cause an error, instead creates a new variable * Some common operations are missing, like a flat function for arrays * Comparing objects is not so easy as comparing arrays * There is three ways of declaring variables (let, var and const). Not so bas of a thing, but can be confusing in the beggining * JS Engines do not understand the latest features, because of that we need to use transpilers like Babel (not a big problem, but configuring Babel can be a bit daunting) * If using NodeJS, getting user input from the terminal is terribly complex for such a simple task Probably there is more, but that is what I though from the top of my head.,;/1
train,;/Most JavaScript developers are cowboys.,;/2
train,;/JavaScript is not a terrible language, but it's far from good. One big reason is the approach it takes to incorrect code: rather than fail outright, it often either tries to guess what you meant, or worse, fails but keeps trucking on until that failure creates a subsequent failure. This loosey-goosey approach to programming.is baffling, because the only people who should be observing software failures should be developers, who want the failure to stop the program hard and fast so that they can fix it. If a programmer tries to compare a string equals a number, don't try to coerce that value into fitting: just error. This leads to some pathological footguns. The one I've run into multiple times is the whole "standard library functions have arguments you never need, and callbacks have arguments you never implement" problem, such as when you try to convert a array of strings into numbers. (["1","2","3"]).map(parseInt) Don't even get me started on shit like "this".,;/1
train,;/> how this keyword works is pure insanity Javascript "this" is the bane of my existence,;/2
train,;/Though that can be said about a lot of popular languages. Python is an even worse offender there in my experience.,;/1
train,;/> `>(["1","2","3"]).map(parseInt)` > out:`[1, NaN, NaN]` So I figured out what is going on with this example. As with everything in JS, it almost makes sense, but not really. To /u/5alidz , this example illustrates perfectly why JS is obnoxious, they had good intentions when designing it, but didn't think things through. You should be able to look at a piece of code and immediately see what it is doing, it is clearly not the case here. Normally, `parseInt` takes a string and a number as a base. E.g. `parseInt("8",10)` means parse "8" as if it were base 10. You can leave arguments out of a function call in javascript and they get a runtime value of `undefined`. Take for example the following function that concatenates two things. If you call it on one thing, it concatenates it with `undefined`. > var foobar = function(x,y){ return x + ":" + y } > foobar(1) out: "1:undefined" The function `parseInt` uses 10 if the base is equal to `undefined` so you get a reasonable behavior if you just call it with a number and no base. E.g `parseInt("8")` yields `8` as expected. Now, lets try your example with my `foobar` function. > (["1","2","3"]).map(foobar) out: ["1:0", "2:1", "3:2"] That actually kinda makes sense. Map with two arguments assumes you wanted the second argument to be the array index. So, now we can unpack the weird `[1,NaN,NaN]` from earlier. Passing a zero to parseInt is giving it a "falsey" value. If you use `undefined` or `0` in a conditional, the conditional takes the else branch. So... This is kinda weird, but almost makes sense: > parseInt("1",0) out: 1 Now, if we try base 1 or 2 we get NaN. 1 makes sense, there is no reasonable way to give it a [Peano number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms). 3 also makes sense since base 2 doesn't have a "3" character. > parseInt("3",2) out: NaN > parseInt("10",2) out: 2 Now, compare my earlier `foobar` function in scala: >def foobar(x:(String,Int)):String = x._1 + ":" + x._2 >List("1","2","3").zipWithIndex.map(foobar) out: List("1:0", "2:1", "3:2") Notice how the call to `zipWithIndex` clearly documents that the intention is to pass the value and index into foobar. If you remove `zipWithIndex`, the code won't even compile saving you some very hard debugging later.,;/2
train,;/Try these [600+ DSA problems](https://www.techiedelight.com/list-of-problems/). Start with easy, followed by medium and finally hard category. Preferred sequence is Array, Linked List, Binary Tree, BST, Stack, Queue, Matrix, Dynamic Programming, Heap... and finally Graphs.,;/3
train,;/Take the other's advice for prep. But just remember that an interview should be a conversation. A good interviewer will want you to engage them about the problem. If you spew off some memorized algorithm they won't be impressed. But if you discuss why you took that approach, what the tradeoffs are, and ask for context about the problem that may help you decide an algorithm (is the input data sorted, is the input data very large, is the system memory constrained, is a perfect sort necessary or would a heap be enough, will the data structure be ready or written more often, etc) then the interviewer will be able to learn more about how you think about problems. On the job the algorithms you know doesn't matter much. It'll be rare for a problem to arise that specifically requires you to build a raw BST, or implement a sorting function. What matters is that you are able to reason about problems. So learn the algorithms. Just also learn how to think about algorithms and how to talk about your mindset and approach too. Both matter.,;/1

train,;/I think I've seen something similar with scanners/copiers and currency... I always wondered how that works!,;/2
train,;/Currency is quite an interesting case - it's not quite machine learning but a lot of currency has a hidden pattern embedded in it (e.g. the [EURion constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURion_constellation) for banknotes). Printer firmware and image manipulation software can detect these patterns and prevent the reproduction of any image containing the pattern.,;/1
train,;/All of that can be defeated. There's a reason why you can get full quality rips of movies on torrents right now. That won't change even if they make dumb features like these.,;/2
train,;/**[EURion constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURion constellation)** The EURion constellation (also known as Omron rings or doughnuts) is a pattern of symbols incorporated into a number of secure documents such as banknotes and ownership title certificates designs worldwide since about 1996. It is added to help imaging software detect the presence of such a document in a digital image. Such software can then block the user from reproducing banknotes to prevent counterfeiting using colour photocopiers. According to research from 2004, the EURion constellation is used for colour photocopiers but probably not used in computer software.

train,;/When you start your internship at a company, no one is going to expect you to just be able to do something right off the bat. You're an intern for a reason. They very well know that they're going to be helping you grow as a programmer and it's your job to ask questions and fill in the void through learning. I never expect my interns to just know what to do if I give them a task on day 1. All I expect of them is to have an openness to learning and ask questions to help progress that learning.,;/1
train,;/Thank you! This is good news.,;/2
train,;/Hmm. Much more clear now. Thank you!,;/2
train,;/I took a Data Structures course but I didn't know the rest. I'm putting this on my learning list. Thank you!,;/2
train,;/I've found that the companies I've worked at don't expect an engineer to be net-positive on productivity for at least a month, and junior engineers at least two months. It takes time to get familiar with a codebase - even moreso if you're not familiar with the industry. Not something to be worried about - just make sure you take in as much as you can and are willing to ask questions and admit your mistakes. Also, like /u/theCumCatcher said, if the company isn't understanding that you're gonna need time to get your bearings, you shouldn't work for that company. Everyone who has studied CS and gone into software development knows that a CS degree doesn't get you 100% prepared to be a developer - it just gives you the tools to get started.,;/1
train,;/As a senior dev who has been doing software engineering for well over a decade, in my eyes knowing design patterns and practicing not slinging together spaghetti code is the most valuable thing. I know so many programmers who just "make stuff work", either due to pressure or just not caring, but it's usually such an utter cluster for someone else to get in there and fix when they need to (and they usually will...). Code for your colleagues in mind, not for your "in-the-moment" self. Pick up some good books to read: * Art of readable code * Clean Architecture * Clean Code,;/1
train,;/I think the early agilists had it right when they talked about things in terms of “patterns”. A pattern is a solution to a problem in context, where the problem is one which tends to repeat, and the solution generally results in specific tradeoffs. An important part of a pattern is that it’s not a drag-and-drop solution, but rather is a way of discussing and sharing applicable knowledge that can be customized to fit the situation. Patterns are usually discussed in terms of “design patterns” in code, but the concept can be applied to workflows, communication structures, and just about any aspect of the engineering process. “Best practices” are usually patterns which apply to very common problems and present tradeoffs which are generally beneficial overall. So I would like to tweak your question and instead answer the question, “what would software development be like if everyone sought to draw on existing bodies of knowledge in order to anticipate and manage tradeoffs as intentionally as possible?” - Development would face fewer surprises and pitfalls. - Work would be more methodical: more time would be spent in research and discussion and less time racking up lines of code. - Productivity would slow down at first and then increase overall, for a net gain. - Decision-makers would achieve their aims more frequently, and understand what downsides result from these decisions. Note that these are not inherently enough to make software secure or systems maintainable or jobs fulfilling. It is still up to decision makers to decide what positives they aim for and what negatives they are willing to accept. If the boss is the only one with decision making power, and they’re willing to accept the tradeoffs of engineers being burnt out and systems becoming unmaintainable in order to hit deadlines, then engineers trying to use patterns/“best practices” won’t change anything. Same thing if a company doesn’t care about security. Note also that patterns are contextual, not subjective, and are value-neutral. The tradeoffs resulting from a choice are not subjective, but whether these tradeoffs are acceptable is subjective. There are some practices (testing, version control) that I consider universally good, and for which I cannot imagine a context where their tradeoffs are not worth it. But for most practices there is not a clear cut answer, and I would not believe anybody who tells you that their practice is the universal best. I would equally ignore anyone who tells you that practices are all fully subjective, or that it’s not worth learning “best practices” or patterns from our industry’s collective knowledge.,;/1
train,;/There's no silver bullet. You have to choose one of several best practices or introduce an even better practice.,;/2
train,;/The thing is, there are no universally good nor bad decisions in tech; there are only trade-offs. Any “best practice” always comes with an implicit statement of “assuming this particular trade-off makes sense for your situation”. The trade-offs which make sense for a team of 1000 devs likely don’t make sense for a team of 4. Similarly a start-up and the government will have very different notions about the importance of backwards compat, accessibility, etc. Edit: a good exercise is to reject all statements ala “Foo is bad”, and instead work towards “Choosing Foo would be trading off X for Y, which does / doesn’t make sense for us”,;/1
train,;/Mmm.. never finished? Refactored multiple times on all levels from operators level till abstraction level with every new change? Performance optimization after every change that takes 100x time? Covered in test to the point where writing/fixing tests will takes 50x of time? Every program will be mathematically and logically proved that there no errors inside? P. S. Some best pratices directly contradicts with each other.,;/0
train,;/Best practices are just too loosely defined. It would certainly help readability but beyond that I don't think it'd do much else,;/1
train,;/It would basically look like NASA's software development team. There are strict protocols for pretty much everything from naming to testing etc. Most of your questions, I think, answer themselves. Yes, of course how software is made would change. No, the type of software that could be built would not change. Yes, security would be better. the one question that you did not ask, which I think is relevant, is whether development would still be fun. Part of what keeps people motivated to work is the creativity and engagement component. The more opinionated a process is, the less room there is that for the developer. Much of software development is driven by innovative people. If you create a process which deters that mindset, then you have fewer developers with that trait,;/1
train,;/It would dramatically reduce the variance in quality on projects. About half of so-called "best practices" are simply summarized by "don't be an idiot". Like basic login handling hygiene, and stuff like that. If we got everyone to follow those (either by devine intervention, or more realistically, firing the incompetents), then the worst websites from a security perspective wouldn't be too bad. No SQL injections, plain-text passwords, etc. Unfortunately the other half of things passed around as "best practices" are about dumbing down your code so that you can be replaced with someone worse at your job. Which, while potentially beneficial to the company in the long run, have the potential to neuter the productivity of an experienced software development team, because they limit your ability to approach problems with novel abstractions.,;/1
train,;/I'd say that I've worked in a few teams that has been at least somewhat serious about following best practises. Honestly, it's fucking great, and productivity is easily 5x of what I'm used to in for example enterprise companies where most people hasn't read a best practises blog post since 2002. But it doesn't magically solve all your problems. What you realize once you're fully following "the good path" is that there's lots of unsolved things and broken things that requires lots of thinking and there just isn't any singular best practise that will solve all of your problems. A real-life example: at my current work, we currently don't feel like paying 400 euro a month on a private package repository service, so we host our private libraries on a git SaaS instead. We started out by comitting the ssh access key (obviously not what anyone would call best practises, but it solved the problem - and the libraries we're using isn't exactly super secret anyway, even if they're private on paper, so it *was* the correct decision at first). Our next steps was to use docker build args - while this *does* allow us to no longer commit the credentials (which, again, we're painfully aware is *not a good idea*) but then the problem is that the layers are still part of the docker image, so if someone got access to the docker image they'd also get access to the ssh keys. The *actual* best practise at this point is to use docker secrets - but that isn't supported by our CI/CD-provider... (...arguably, by now we've spent enough time trying to solve this problem (that doesn't have a free zero-work solution!) that we probably should have paid for a private package repo SaaS...). Another example would be fixing dependency problems (underlying libraries being broken for one reason or another) or git merge conflicts: they're fundamentally going to occur not matter what. And no matter what, a LARGE fraction of your time is going to be spent managing these issues. When you're using some business-critical state-of-the-art software that has a dependency that broke and the fix for it ends up being a github issue posted four hours ago... that shit happens.,;/1

train,;/The most difficult thing for me right now as a beginner (and I’m truly starting from zero) is how many people “explain” something in JavaScript without actually explaining it.

It took me asking a lot of questions to figure it out, and when I did I realized it wasn’t me it was the terrible explanations.,;/2
train,;/I have that same problem, especially at school.

There are plenty of Harvard students (so very smart people) who have one on one time with mentors available on campus to help them with the course, and they swear that it's too difficult.,;/1
train,;/There are 1000's of them already AND I would be 100% interested. Every site has a different teaching style, and I learn new and different things every time I visit a new place. It's entirely possible that your unique teaching style may resonate with a niche group of learners who have been struggling elsewhere.,;/1
train,;/> or would i just be making something that hundreds of other people are already doing? It would, but that's shouldn't be a reason to avoid doing this. We re-invent the wheel a lot as we learn. I'd say if you want to do this, do it for your own edification. Maybe you will have a teaching method that's truly different and changes things. Probably not; everyone thinks that their idea is different. But you should still try if you want. Just don't be disappointed if you're the only visitor to your site.,;/1
train,;/I 100% would be interested,;/1
train,;/I think you should. C++ isn't really taught by these modern online courses and I feel that is a big mistake. C++ should be the standard IMO.,;/1
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/I'm right here with you. I think there's room for teaching almost anything \*better\*. Especially with programming. Something I personally haven't seen, and would LOVE, would be one that teaches, and explains differences from C to C++ to C#.,;/2
train,;/Doing it for myself is a good idea. I kind of just wanted to teach it, as teaching is a good way to see how well you understand things yourself, and see what areas you need to learn more about.,;/2
train,;/Things improve if you do have an actual audience that reads it and gives you feedback. It's work to aim stuff at a total beginner, and even if you get good at that, it's so tiring that you often don't get to the advanced stuff. And if you get to the advanced stuff quickly, you probably miss too much of the introductory stuff. Source: Have taught intro programming,;/1
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/>And if you get to the advanced stuff quickly, you probably miss too much of the introductory stuff. This right here. OP, if you meticulously go from beginner to advanced, skipping almost nothing, and make it very easy to skip past topics they already know I think you'd have a great resource. Even better would be to present topics in two or 3 ways, with varying levels of detail. Like maybe beginner version and the advanced version for people who already know how to program. I'd definitely use this resource and I'm sure many people would be on board to contribute.,;/1
train,;/Thanks man! I really appreciate your effort to give a whole course out for free and a reduced price. I'm definitely going to use this,;/1
train,;/The effort alone you go through to give back to the community and find ways to open your content is fantastic. I wish more curators, in this space specifically, came with this mentality and energy! Thanks Al.,;/1
train,;/Thanks! Went to redeem, and turned out I already bought it. Glad to have paid for it though, such a generous and helpful author from what I've heard. Sent the link to a few friends who may be interested. Hoping to maybe learn how to maybe make a webscraper for downloading and organizing podcasts and sermons. It's kind of slow to manually do it... Especially when the sites have their own hosting. I wouldn't want to break any rules by downloading all at once and overloading their servers... But even if I added a timer between downloads, that'd still save me time from having to find each link and manually download it.,;/1
train,;/Great thanks so will there be a new course on second edition or same course will be updated with second edition content? super thanks for this.,;/0

train,;/I read that as "I made 47 years of free c++ tutorials" and was like T_T,;/2
train,;/I did some spot checking to evaluate the quality and didn't spot any major problems. But I did notice your ~~first three~~ second and third array videos aren't valid C++ programs. You're using a common language extension, borrowed from C, called variable length arrays (VLA). In C++, array lengths must be a constant integer expression. Your compiler accepts it because it's being nice, but if you ask it to be strict (`-pedantic` in clang++ and g++), it will reject the program with an error.,;/1
train,;/Awesome, thank you! Will have to check out the vectors tutorial soon. Had more trouble with that in my CS class than anything else Edit: Is there a playlist link you can post? Would make it easier to follow the lessons that way,;/1

train,;/I'm glad to see more stuff like this popping up. So much learning covers basics but then no one talks about real world applications. I'm decent with Python but have no idea how to use it to *make* a user friendly program. It's a daunting gap of knowledge.,;/1
train,;/Honestly, thank you for taking the time to write/type this guide out and for sharing it with us all! I love that everything is broken down so nicely, telling us what to do and what to identify. Ill be looking forward to the part 2 of this! Although, I'm not really sure what it'll do or if it'll benefit you but I "clapped" for your article! I'd like to add that I dont really have any constructive criticisms to give you but I'd like to say that everything you've written is so to the point that it makes me feel better reading it. I get tired when people write paragraphs upon paragraphs on a topic that could've been easily condensed into a few sentences that would have made it much easier to understand, though I understand that some topics needs to explained thoroughly so they're lengthy but oftentimes most of them do not need to be lengthy, just like this part of this comment, to further prove my point.,;/2
train,;/I need this so much. I know 3 languages, and have no idea how to make anything other than fancy calculators. I've asked around on reddit, and forums, and all I got was vague and unhelpful tips like "Oh, calculators might be useful to someone",;/2
train,;/As a student that is juggling many projects this is a coherent guide, and easily understandable to share with my group. I LOVE this, and really broadened my understanding of how management of tasks could be achieved. Thank you !,;/2
train,;/This looks really great. Consider publishing it somewhere in addition to Medium. Medium is a cash grab and actually blocks your content from people in their attempt to charge users.,;/1
train,;/How do you work with the security aspect of webapps and mobile apps? Anyone building apps may or may not be aware of testing if there are security flaws. How does one deal with it and how do you deal with them?,;/0
train,;/I think you need to look up project oriented tutorials and courses. Corey Schafer's channel bon YouTube has good project oriented tutorials for Django, Flask and Data Science. You can also try out Python related courses from University of Michigan where you learn to build simple projects from scratch(Coursera). Also let me not forget Sentdex's channel on YouTube. He is certainly the king of Python for learners. He has great tutorials for covering almost everything in Python though the one's related to AI, Deep learning and Machine learning are the best one's. Don't get stuck in tutorial hell for long.,;/1
train,;/Oh my god, yes! This was so frustrating when I tried to learn Python a couple years ago... It's like there was this weird void between beginner tutorials that taught you syntax and advanced lessons that taught you like... I dunno, complex algorithms or something (they were well over my head, obviously) but absolutely NOTHING to bridge the gap between them.,;/2
train,;/> I get tired when people write paragraphs upon paragraphs on a topic that could've been easily condensed into a few sentences that would have made it much easier to understand Hahaha 😂 Thank you this made me laugh!! You definitely could have ended it at the first comma 😉. The post was actually almost twice as long before I realized at that pace I would be writing a text book and started deleting most of what I had written (it was not easy!). On the other hand I've read a lot of tutorials and guides that leave you wanting more. You read it and you're like, 'that's it??'. I tried to strike a balance by adding links to more resources in the 'Further Reading' section, so people can delve deeper into any of the topics. >Ill be looking forward to the part 2 of this! Thanks! You're feedback makes me more excited to finish writing it!!,;/1
train,;/I haven't done in Python for quite some time but mentioning Sentdex gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside. Great suggestion.,;/2
train,;/don't forget about this [1000+ pdf collection](https://github.com/tpn/pdfs),;/3
train,;/Who put this together?,;/0
train,;/*Sigh* this is literally too much information for noobs. "Where do I start" is probably the biggest problem for people.,;/2

train,;/Amazing collection! For some reason, Github truncated it to just 1000, with 46 omitted,;/1

train,;/Good luck man! Let's get it! Learn by coding as much as you can.,;/3
train,;/What kind of programming are you trying to get into?,;/0
train,;/I am really glad for you! Inspirational story to you: one of my teammate in the past was from a small willage in Sri Lanka. Even today his home village still has no electricity. He is an iOS engineer, pretty good one. My first personal computer was ZX Spectrum, handmade by my father. My own first PC was 286, which motherboard and RAM was gifted to me by my classmate in the university. I used to buy a power supply and used pretty old black-and-green CRT monitor from soviet union coputer from the before-pc era.,;/2
train,;/Refurbished pc's can be a fantastic deal, especially if they have a warranty just in case you get an unlucky pick.,;/1
train,;/OP, what country are you from?,;/0
train,;/For now, web-Development, especially backend and I would also like to make Android Apps one day. In the very long-term, I would love to get into /AI/Machine Learning,;/2
train,;/Fingers crossed! It wasn't easy saving and splurging like that on a PC,;/2
train,;/give databases and the SQL language a shot, also. It seems like it wouldn't be creative but it's very fun,;/1
train,;/I currently got sidelined into a database migration at work. Normally I do regularly software development. I hate it. Massive queries with 400 lines and 10+ joins. Its a nightmare! From now on I will be the guy that does backend fixes. I do not recommend!,;/1
train,;/>Massive queries with 400 lines and 10+ joins Stop! My penis can only get so erect! One man's trash is another man's treasure, lol. Hire me and I'll do it instead. :),;/1
train,;/I like what you're doing. I'd make some code structure tweaks. First, in all your classes you have an odd mix of class variables and instance variables. When you do this: class SpeedTest(object): download = "" upload = "" latency = "" jitter = "" You're defining class variables here. And then later accessing them as instance variables. If you're limiting things to only one instance it's still better to use instance variables here, by initializing them in an `__init__(self):` function. class SpeedTest(object): def __init__(self): self.download = "" self.upload = "" self.latency = "" self.jitter = "" Second, in your `__main__`, you 1) make a SpeedTest instance, 2) call its init_driver function to initialize a driver, then 3) call a method of your SpeedTest instance and inject that driver back in as a parameter. That's kind of wonky. What I'd do is have a separate class that would create and initialize a driver, then create a SpeedTest object with that driver as a parameter: if __name__=='__main__': driver = DriverFactory.createFireFoxDriver(wait=5) speedtest = SpeedTest(driver) then class SpeedTest: def __init__(self, driver): self.driver = driver It makes sense since your SpeedTest class can't do anything without a web driver, so you can constrain instantiation to require a driver. Then you could easily test other web drivers if you so needed. Third, Some naming schemes don't sit well with me. speedtest.get_data() Implies that it would return some form of data. But that's not what's happening. Also, what happens if you call `get_data()` before you call `run_test(driver)`? It looks like you'll just log that you couldn't find the data, which is good, but there's probably a safer way to deal with the workflow here. Anyway, it's a good script. There's a lot of room for improvement and plenty of ground to get lost in feature creep ;-p,;/1
train,;/Very cool! If you have an interruption will it tweet them when it comes back online? "Just so you know, ISP, my service was disconnected last night from xxxx to xxxx.",;/0
train,;/This is amazing.,;/2
train,;/I ***almost*** wish my ISP was crappy enough to run these. Almost. Thanks charter! Always get my advertise speed (and often more!),;/2
train,;/You're awesome, this is exactly what I was hoping for. Thank you for taking the time to go through it and provide clear, actionable recommendations.,;/1
train,;/I really like that idea. I think modifying something like [this script](https://github.com/mrpappas/surfboard_log.py) I wrote this past weekend to monitor my modem's RF signal levels would be better for that application. That way instead of just a failed page load throwing an exception you could still keep logs / gather whatever information actually is available. (I am still able to access my modems gateway when it has no connection).,;/1
train,;/Google Fiber has spoiled me. > @GoogleFiber Hey what gives! I pay for Gigabit download and upload. Why am I only getting 950Mbps down and 995Mbps up?,;/0
train,;/No problem. It's a really good exercise to write something small like this, then spend time refactoring it based on best practices. I always recommend reading Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. You can find pdfs of it online. Excellent read. Would definitely help you out.,;/3
train,;/I've been looking for a 'best practices' book like that for a while - thanks for the recommendation! What would you say the prerequisites are for being able to comprehend a book like that? (E.g. I've taken a couple intro programming classes and written some scripts at work, could I jump into that book?),;/2
train,;/It has tons of actual code, but doesn't require much programming experience. It's a good book for beginners.,;/2
train,;/Congrats man! I’m “learning” to code, and my parents think I’m some kind of prodigy, but I haven’t even touched my editor since school got out. I’m glad you have the dedication to learn something that I don’t. But I may revisit it after this post! Thanks for the motivation!,;/2
train,;/I’m convinced there is something super valuable about not telling anyone about the work you are doing. I am trying to decide how to best go about learning to code currently and will use this post as guidance. Thank you!,;/2
train,;/***CSS- The complete guide 2020 (Maximilian S., Udemy). I hated this course so much. Zero sense of aesthetics. The project and examples are so ugly. Just so hard to sit through.

train,;/How did you learn CSS before HTML, considering it's the language that dictates how HTML itself should be styled? And congrats!,;/0
train,;/This might be a little early for you, but something that can truly help your programming and software development skills is the (free) Nand2Tetris courses on Coursera (Part 1 and 2). Part 1 gives you an understanding of the hardware and logical fundamentals that underlie all software, by walking you through the process of designing a very simple computer from scratch. Part 2 walks you through creating a programming language of your own - understanding how languages are built and work under the hood can help you to appreciate the most effective ways to use them. The course is really well put together, with all sorts of materials available, and taught me a lot. It takes a task that seems gargantuan (creating a game of Tetris by first designing a computer and various levels of programming language) and make it really achievable - even if you have to scratch your head a fair bit too get through it at times! Good luck, and stay motivated Edit: typos,;/1
train,;/Yeah man, a little bit every day. There were a few days in there I was only able to do 1 hour, and I counted that as a win.,;/2
train,;/It is more important to build a habit than to rely on motivation(whatever that is) if you want to succeed in life.,;/2
train,;/There was a study done about this. Basically, if you tell people "I'm going to lose 50lbs, just started with this diet and this exercise routine, blahblahblah," you've already received a lot of positive feedback. No need to DO anything after that! But by keeping quiet until after the fact, you don't settle for the positive compliments, you're motivated to earn them. Something like that.,;/1
train,;/Literally the key to success is building successful habits.,;/2
train,;/Exactly. I've taught myself other things in the past (with much less rigor, and results), but I think there was something about that delayed gratification the pushed me forward this time. Hopefully that isn't all undone now lol.,;/2
train,;/The work within fear is very insightful. Thanks!, first time intern right now , living constant in fear,;/1
train,;/Good to know, but realistically- how can someone devote 6-12 months learning one thing? These days to become even just a front end dev you need: some knowledge of the back end, usually a web framework. html css javascript whatever front end library is cool these days Database query languages like SQL/ Mongo testing and testing frameworks some deployment these days something like docker and kubernetes You're looking at at least 3 years of learning, and this isn't even for a back end or full stack dev. As for me, I graduated from a part time bootcamp at the end of 2019. Learned Ruby, Rails, Js, React/ Redux, html, a little css, and a little SQL. I hit interviewing and had never even heard of big O. Now almost a year later, l have had around 5 interviews progress to second round and have not made it farther. I've tried to fill in the gaps. I agree spreading yourself too thin isn't smart, but someone in my position cannot spend a year on javascript alone.,;/1

train,;/To anyone reading this post. This is some of the best advise you’re going to get. Read it. Bookmark it. Read it again in a couple of months and then in a couple of years. This is evergreen wisdom.,;/2
train,;/Great advice! Alot of things sure hit home. I will say that I'm now using Anki for Spaced Repetition. In my job as a SysAdmin I often do tasks only once every few years. Several times I've forgotten or didn't write it down and spent weeks unraveling it.,;/2
train,;/I have such bad imposter syndrome.... this is a great post. Always feeling not good enough like I’m about to be found out.,;/2
train,;/[deleted],;/3
train,;/6-12 months on one STACK. Choose a stack and master it. A stack may have 1 language, 3-5 libraries, and 2-3 different backend technologies you have to master, but you learn them in turn, as you build things. So really, that's 6-12 months of building things with your chosen stack.,;/1
train,;/I actually agree with you on this. *'One thing'* doesn't necessarily mean only CSS or only HTML. I don't think a junior dev will get anywhere, to be honest. Rather, *'one thing'* is only Flask or only React. Not Flask and React – AND Django. I guess in a sense, *one thing* means project level focus. But then again, it depends on your prior experience and eventual goal. For instance, if one's never heard of HTML, they're better off spending a month in that. Then CSS next. Then maybe a little intro to SQL. Before jumping into Flask/Django. So technically, the first few months will be spent on basic, no-framework-esque learning. But only after that can the person start going into Frameworks. I learned Django when it was hot. And I can't tell you the number of other shiny frameworks that came out that many switched to. And the eventual outcome was even more confusion and frustration. Learning is incredibly hard! The takeaway for learners is to focus on things that collectively make sense instead of chasing after latest framework out there. It may give you a temporarily thrill but thrills don't last. Let me know if this makes sense.,;/1
train,;/On the other side there are many professions where a degree is a hard requirement. No one is going to become a lawyer, accountant or doctor by doing a bootcamp and some online courses, not even after 5 years of doing that. The fact that you can become a software engineer without ever going to school or from a completely different background is amazing to me. It's a very good thing. Yea it sucks that getting hired is hard, but there's not much to be done about it, it's supply and demand. I don't think it's that weird to spend a lot of time learning one thing either. I also started with sort of a bootcamp and while it certainly helped me learn the basics of Java, JS, HTML and CSS I'm still learning a ton about JS even after working with it for 2 years. I just now started learning React. Even colleagues that have been programming professionally for 10 years still have areas of their expertise that they haven't even touched yet. There's a whole world out there of stuff to learn.,;/2
train,;/Thanks,;/2
train,;/Make sure you clear this with your employer. I am a professor but I don't own the copyright on my lectures, my employer does because it was done for them for money. That means I can't distribute them outside our approved systems and they don't want students or staff passing things around on YouTube. Some schools really like seeing public content, some curate some material for the public and others don't like any of it, but it's usually up to them not you what can be done with that work.,;/2

train,;/Good point, I will check. These materials are for an external workshop that is not linked to my employer (which is all in the clear), however, I did use my themed slides so that might be an issue. Thanks for the heads-up!,;/2
train,;/to elaborate on Tieskmans answer. Id say the first topic is one that would be reasonably relevant for someone that is completely new to python and coding. The remainder of the course is very specialized, focused on data collection and processing as far as I can see, which might not be that relevant to all beginners. Depends on what sort of stuff you'd like to do with your programming. If you'd like to retrieve data from the web, and make statistical analysis of it, this sounds absolutely great, but I have a feeling most beginners won't go down this avenue. If you are completely new I would recommend finding a different python course, that is more focused on the basics. Some grasp the basics really fast, while others spend a lot of time on it. Seeing as this is intended for Phd students it should give you an idea of how you are in relation to them. They have basically spent their life learning how to learn efficiently, so if you havent done that it might take a bit more time for you. I think theres better ways than this to learn coding basics, which are more fun and engaging, provide a better foundation, and touch on topics that are more relevant to the general programmer. TLDR; this is a programming course for people with a special application in mind.,;/1

I think it's one of the fastest shots to a career out there (that being said don't put a time limit on your self in these early stages it's certainly a journey to learn programming).

train,;/This is a great list and thank you for the suggestions! I am currently working through a course on The Odin Project and have found it very helpful so far, would recommend it! Also, I found an app called Mimo that is sort of similar to duolingo but for learning web development and I’ve found that to be a good resource for reviewing as well!,;/1
train,;/I agree 100% with you on this! I started TOP a few days ago, and am almost done with the Front End Basics section in the Web Development Introduction portion of the Full Stack JavaScript track (man that was detailed lol). I FREAKING LOVE IT! I've tried so many other courses and nothing comes close to TOP. Hands down the best,;/2
train,;/Just wanted to add, I am a developer but I still went through the Odin Project purely because I was not super comfortable in Linux *and* I wanted to learn web development. I was purely a backend developer before, with minor front-end stuff I had picked up for minimal UI building, but zero knowledge on integrating my work with the web. It was a phenomenal journey that gave me great value and experience.,;/1

train,;/How do you recommend I approach the Odin project? How much time a day do you spend on it? I’m planning on doing it along CS50, so I would like to hear your thoughts on that?,;/0
train,;/Hey! CS50 is HARD, make no mistake. It took me months to finish, but I really recommend it (especially the first 2/3rds). It does an awesome job of explaining some of the gritty details that might be missed on codacademy/treehouse/etc. If you like the online class approach, OSSU is a really good guide for well rounded CS. Alternatively, if you have a pretty good idea of what you're going for, p1XT is really good too. Good luck!,;/1
train,;/I picked the Full Stack JavaScript track. Just follow what they have laid out there for you. However, you can do what I'm doing, and that's create a folder system on your Bookmarks Bar. It's one folder dedicated strictly to TOP. In that main folder are many subfolders that I'm building out as I go through the course. Each sub folder is dedicated to specific sections of the course. Especially the recommended readings that they have in each section. Just save each one to a designated folder for later reading & reference. I spend about 8-10 hours per day. Mainly because I'm kind of on a time crunch and need to be job-ready by March 2020. Also, open up your favorite note-taking app and take notes. Doing so will help your brain do some magic as far as solidifying this newfound knowledge. CS50 is cool if you wanna learn some theory, but don't devote so much time to it if you're serious about going through TOP. This course is strictly hands on with very little hand holding. CS50 is good when you're pretty much done for the day on regards to TOP and want to squeeze in some theory to end the day.,;/1
train,;/I wish I’d known CS50 was that hard. I tried to start it, got lost repeatedly, gave up thinking I can’t even keep up with a freshman class.,;/1

Since I have a full-time (most of the time i work 12hrs a day) job and a family and I didn't know what options i have and where to begin - I just dived into fullstack webdev and decided that I can adjust my path later, when I know more about programming and my preferences. Your work really helps with the decision making. Again, thank you so much. You rock!,;/2
train,;/just a friendly reminder that no learning road map should be linear. if you started with a different step or skipped a few steps or messed up the order just keep on going. as long as you're doing *something,* as long as you're taking a step forward, please continue! you're doing great.,;/2

train,;/This is exactly where I am, except 8-10 hour days. Try and learn code 1-2 hours every day after work. I’m actually excited to go home and learn to code. Especially in hopes of trying to find a new career with it. Excited to use this site to help with the process.,;/1
train,;/That was the intention with which I started building this tool. I think a central repository where people could explore their career options would be really really valuable. Hopefully, I can scale this from tech roadmaps to roadmaps for all kinds of jobs!,;/1
train,;/Exactly! My hope is that people could see multiple roadmaps and build one for them. Then it's just iteration. You decide to follow something, but then you don't like it, so you change it. Trial and error till you make it!,;/1
train,;/I'm very good at a couple of things, but programming isn't yet one of them. I am currently in tutorial hell, and your essay is exactly what I needed to read. Thank you.,;/1
train,;/I‘ve not only been stuck in tutorial hell before but also sometimes my need for perfection and fear of failing at a specific project have kept me from working on them. It took me sometime to realize that I can‘t expect my projects to be flawless. Just keep on making stuff. Perfection kills progress. Sorry if this is off topic.,;/1
train,;/I’ve been there and of course it depends on the tutorial and other things, but I honestly believe it’s down to your mindset and goals. Start every tutorial with this following mindset and goals: 1. When I learn something new (which is usually every lesson) then I’ll stop the tutorial and practice that lesson until I’m confident. 2. Watching a tutorial won’t help me get any better. 3. Practicing what I’ve learnt will 4. Watching videos doesn’t mean I’m learning. It’s only fake learning. Watching and practicing is learning. Teaching it to other people is mastering.,;/1
train,;/I love this and it is a great framing of the problems I had during the first few years of trying to learn. An exercise that I do, which fits the philosophy above, is that, for any tutorial I do, I have a rule that I need to build three things with it. Take the concept and apply it to two modified versions or extensions of what you’ve learned. This isn’t enough to know something but it is enough that, when you have to reengage the topic at a later time, it tends to feel a lot more familiar. Great post,;/1
train,;/Awesome! I started to learn HTML and CSS in January. My first approach was strictly reading the information at W3schools, but I retained very little. It also took quite a while. Now, I am taking this course on Udemy that gives me challenges to do on the way, and that approach has been much more effective into actually being able to implement what I learn.,;/1
train,;/You're welcome!,;/2
train,;/Follow a curriculum that relies on small projects to apply your knowledge. Every project after that compounds on the knowledge of the one before. ie: The Odin project is working great for me on this aspect. Don't get stuck on a project or problem too long. If you can't break it down to smaller problems and solve it. Refresh your theory and then go back a week later or so, or find a similar project (using same fundamentals) you can complete.,;/1

train,;/As a retired developer you are spot on. I remember my first programming class and I was lost. This was the early 80s, in night school, I was too stupid for Basic language. Everyone else got it and I was an idiot. I struggled through it but was discouraged. Then we learned assembly(remember early 80s) and I was too stupid, until one night when it clicked in my brain. I started to see a computer as a machine, no different from a transmission in a vehicle, I understand those. My career was around systems and their internals, sometimes I had a lot of fun implementing low level solution before their was a great solution.,;/1
train,;/I just went through code academy for Java and I understand maybe 20% of it. I think what helps me is realizing they are just teaching concepts and how basic things work so when you need to utilize those concepts they aren't totally alien to you.,;/1
train,;/Syntax is easy. Programming is hard. Whenever I'm learning a new language, I have *tons* of tabs opened with "how to do X in Y language". Even in Python (the language I'm most familiar with) there are still things that I forget the syntax for and have to look up every single time. But I pretty much always know what to search for these days, and that's the real skill (or at least that's what I tell myself to make myself feel better).,;/1
train,;/I see myself as a fairly smart person (hope that doesn’t sound too pompous) and I started codecademy Data Scientist course about a month ago. I was flying through it at first and felt great, then started to get into projects where you are really integrating everything you’ve learned into a real program using functions and classes and I felt that I may be too dumb to do it as well. But thanks to posts like this I am persisting and really just work on reviewing the material repetitively and using different sources until I throughly understand before moving on. I believe it is a lot of hard work but if you really put your mind to it and look into all sorts of different explanations and examples then you can be successful,;/1
train,;/Literally same. Honestly ignoring how well others are doing in the bootcamp is the only thing that helps.,;/1
train,;/i'll use one for you,;/2
train,;/One thing I can tell you is, that you should be incredibly proud of yourself. That was a good post. The realities of having a remote job... I wish someone could emphasize more on that for people, really. Keep up the good work, OP!,;/1
train,;/> I had wasted a lot of time building out features that were not wanted. As a developer for the past coming up to 4 years, i can not stress this point enough to anyone getting in to the industry. &nbsp; Code to your requirements, no more, no less. Do exactly what it says on the tin. &nbsp; The extra time you may spend on adding cool little features of functionality you think will be useful or the client will really like will most likely go unused, the code will never be touched and will end up becoming this horrible monster that sits in your application that will cost you time and effort to remove or refactor later down the road. Instead spend that time refactoring the code that meets the specifications, building automated tests (both unit and integration) that tests as many aspects of your code as possible. hell spend time at the start of the project designing and architecting your project, because it will highlight issues you will never think of once you get tunnel vision'd on writing code. All of this will make the project easier to come back to in the future, make it easier to extend / update and know that any changes you make have plenty of tests covering you so that you dont break existing functionality, and if you do, will highlight exactly where the bug you have introduced is. It may be less fun doing all this than messing around with the code, but you will be so happy you did.,;/1
train,;/That was one hell of a post and it really spoke to me man. Really. I'm in this part of my life where I feel like a big transition is needed, but getting there is hard. Yes, you can say "Well look at what you got. The entirety of human knowledge is available online. Just read a lot and you can learn anything!" So much easier said than done. There are so many things I've been reading lately that seem to go right over my head, make me feel dumb and my lifelong habit when I feel dumb has been to back away and quit, so I won't feel like that anymore. Having the perseverance to push through is something I've had a hard time finding, but I'll get there. It's just....it feels weird starting over at 32 in something that even 14 year olds are better at me in. I feel like I'm in kindergarten and everybody else is in high school,;/1

train,;/This is the first "I started learning to code X ago and I've been hired" post I've actually gotten something out of. This is an amazing post, thanks a lot! :),;/1
train,;/I haven't had a remote job before, although I would like one. Personally I have no idea why being able to work in a public place would be appealing. I just want to work at home where it's quiet, I have my comforts, can listen to embarassing music without judgement and don't feel like anyone is looking over my shoulder! (I have a job interview for a semi-remote job next week, hoping I get it!),;/1
train,;/I've worked remote since 94. Just plain working at home, though -- no sitting on the beach coding the next big thing. I have no regrets. Starting with being there to watch my kids grow up and ending with missing all of the lovely office politics. Every time I leave a client site I laugh inside after being reminded yet again why I love working out of office so much. You need to set work boundaries -- you need to make sure you stop working and return to home stuff every now and then. You need to get out of the house to take a break. Keep distractions to a minimum. Far easier at home since you are (mostly) in control there. All on you though. You need to convince all of your family, relatives and friends that you do indeed have a real job and that you are not available 24/7 for running errands -- although it's sweet that you can pretty much run an errand 24/7. Don't blow your cash on fancy stuff especially when starting out, but when you're settled in and secure, spring for a nice office setup. It makes a huge difference to work in a professional environment. Along the lines of being secure, if you're self employed you need to do all the saving for retirement, take care of health insurance (in US at least), and pay them taxes. It initially feels like you've got a ton of money rolling in and then you get that first tax bill. I've known several developers that have forgotten this step and go broke after their first year. Get and accountant to help you out.,;/1
train,;/I can relate to wanting to quit when something makes me feel dumb. I feel like I have done this most of my life. I think what made me stick with this was surrounding myself with a helpful community at meetups. Also the feeling dumb this is going to happen to you again and again. You will get to some concept that goes way over your head and feel like giving up. Over time if you stick with it that concept will start to click and you will eventually grasp it. The best part about this process is now you are learning how to learn (I thought this was cliche bullshit at first) What I mean is the next time you get to a subject where you find yourself overwhelmed and feeling stupid you now can think back to last time you had this feeling and the steps you took to overcome it. This thought process helps me relax. I try not to beat myself up for not getting something right away because now I have the experience to know that these things take time but if I stick with it I will eventually grasp the concept.,;/1
train,;/I've had a remote job, an office job, and a combo. Hardest things about being remote is staying on task. It is so much easier to let yourself wander with no one watching. Second hardest is the loneliness. You are basically home all the time and so you end up hating it. You don't interact with coworkers. It seems cool at first but it eventually wears you down. Right now I have a combo. Our team gets to work from home Tuesdays and fridays...and I still go in to work a lot of the time those days. Work is where work is done and so I am more motivated. I also play boardgames over lunch with my coworkers and it's fun. Of course everyone is different. I just remember thinking working from home would be a blast but ended up hating it personally.,;/2
train,;/I recently visited my best bro in Virginia for his wedding. He works remotely from home for dish network. He plays rust and WoW during work. He literally has 2 PCs, side by side, in an L shaped desk and he spins his chair from one to another, on the fly, as needed. Not gonna lie, way better than my job.,;/2
train,;/Just saved your post, this gave me that second wind to continue to learn C++, thanks OP. &#x200B;,;/1
train,;/I'd be curious to know the resources you used to learn. Especially the algorithms and data structures,;/1
train,;/> The memory model and the call stack will then no longer be something complex and your code will get better and you'll learn coding faster. No longer you'll wonder why you can't mutate a string or why why you pass non primitive types by reference rather than value. Just a note that high-level language systems nowadays (the majority of the ones you mentioned, other than C) are often written so many levels above the CPU and kernel that the reasoning for certain basic decisions is generally *not* “Because the computer does it this way”. What your specific language/runtime decide to pass by value or reference, or whether strings are mutable, etc, are mainly opinionated quality-of-life choices, rather than just “because the hardware/computer works this way”. So while your point about learning the nuances of how computers store and process data is valid in part, I’d be careful not to jump to conclusions, given how many layers are often between the language and the underlying hardware in 2018.,;/1
train,;/It's a great post. I'd say the only nitpick is saying don't learn from videos. How people learn is very personal, and videos may help a lot for beginners to get large concepts. Doing the work is what is needed at the end of the day, but understanding how can be reached by a number of methods.,;/1
train,;/Thanks, I'm curious about what your schedule was like over those 9 months. As someone that has been self-teaching full time for 4 months, I'm interested in how others structure their time and prioritize. I am learning, watching and building M-F from 9-5 and treating it like a job. Discrete goals of understanding JavaScript (and React) deeply and C# shallowly.,;/1
train,;/Saw Cherno's video about cutting out videos and just write some real code, and if you need a resource then go buy a book. Fascinating how successful people give this "just do it" advice. I have probably watched 100s of hours of videos on c++, and now I've committed to doing an hour today, I realise how little I don't know / can't make (and am loving it).,;/1
train,;/There's a free book called Algorithms and Data Structures by Nikolaus Wirth. Might have been published in 1985 but it's still a decent book. http://freecomputerbooks.com/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-by-Niklaus-Wirth.html,;/3
train,;/Not OP but I discovered this book 'Grokking Algorithms' from a fantastic youtube channel 'The Coding Train'. The book explains a lot of the algorithms and data structures that I am learning in my first sem of CS at school. This thing even has the stuff that I am going to learn in the next semster. I found this book much more fun than my monotonous textbooks. If anyone wants to get a good grasp of the fundamentals of A&DS this is a great starting point and then move on to MOOCs by famous Universities. MIT's A&DS was the one that I used. Dunno if it's still available on YouTube because I remember that OCW courses were removed or something? [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230),;/1
train,;/Yeah that’s a silly blanket statement. I sit next to one of our senior devs and he was asked to write something in a language he wasn’t familiar with and videos got him through it. Videos have their time and place. I would edit that bullet to say don’t rely solely on videos to learn.,;/1
train,;/That's why I love cheat sheets and just reading the docs. Because if you know the concept, everything else is just a search away.,;/1
train,;/I got out in 2018 and have struggled to get a decent job. I have been turned down by many jobs . Then my friend a web developer, who got a degree in Arizona .

So what works for me is to check out a lot of online tools and websites with APIs, trying to figure out if it could be improved in some way. And trying to implement the optimization. I did two projects this way and it was extremely rewarding. Trying to force yourself to do something you don't like is a quick way to lose interest in this field and burn out.,;/1
train,;/THANK YOU. There's been a huge amount of "build something!" posts, but I tend to get overwhelmed trying to come up with an idea to build. This is great.,;/1
train,;/Not all heroes wear capes! Thank you !,;/1
train,;/Awesome list! Thank you for putting it together!,;/1
train,;/Wonderful list you've got going there! I'd also highly recommend adding [this project ideas repo from Florin Pop](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). It's catered towards web development, but has some awesome project inspiration regardless of your tech stack!,;/1
train,;/Alternatively, building something is a great way to be inspired for an idea to build another thing you have passion for.,;/2
train,;/Got some bad news about industry my friend,;/2
train,;/What exactly do you mean by improving APIs?,;/0
train,;/For what it's worth, I started learning about two years ago and it took me until just a few months ago to really start having project ideas popping up in my mind. I used to get overwhelmed trying to think of things too and couldn't think of anything to do other than the same old list apps or clone apps, and those weren't really "projects" to me so I hated working on it but could never think of anything else,;/1
train,;/While working in a job the money is the reward, so I can handle doing uninspired work. ;),;/2
train,;/Not every company is going to ask you complicated questions. I agree with doing your best to prepare but at some point you need to get an actual job. I just finished an Android app for a company I'm working for, I used 0 algorithms. Most people will not be solving complicated problems day to day. In my opinion read the cracking the coding interview, refresh data structures, common algorithms, know their big o, and go interview. You might not get a job at a top 5 tech company but you will get a job if you are competent. Same goes for other careers you want to drive an F1 car? Your body needs to be in optimal shape, reaction times well beyond average human, however, you can drive in a less demanding races, if you were not born for it. Posts like this give this idea that everyone needs to be an all star and study all the time to even get a job.,;/1
train,;/*Disclaimer* There are TONS of great companies to work for that aren't 1/100 as intense as Google or Facebook.,;/2
train,;/Good job on getting the interview! Let us know if you got it. Something I wish I did earlier was maintain a portfolio. I did some projects but never bothered to put them on Github. Never bothered to finish them. Once I learned what I wanted to learn from this project I gave up on it. So to anyone starting out: Put your stuff online. You can still delete some stuff when you're ready to start applying for jobs, if you don't want employers to see it.,;/1
train,;/Also, accept that being mediocre is OK too. You don't have to be a big shot programmer working at a big shot company 80 hours a week to be considered successful. Do your best, do it correctly, be proud of the work you do, and don't worry if you're not Google material.,;/1
train,;/20+ years in the industry, and I've worked as a developer for fortune 500 names. The one thing I wish someone had told me was that the on-site perks companies like google offer -- game rooms, cafeterias, showers, gyms, laundry facilities, daycare, etc. -- are not there for your benefit as an employee. They are there so that you have fewer and fewer reasons to leave. Don't let the existence or lack thereof of these things influence you during your salary negotiations!,;/1
train,;/I'm always torn after reading a post like this and have seen very similar posts on /r/cscareerquestions. I have nearly 2 years commercial experience working in IT now out of college, 1 in data science/machine learning, and the other in backend java, and I've never put in nearly as much work into studying/prepping for jobs as people like OP do. That's not to belittle how much work/prep they do, I admire how much commitment people like OP have to this field. This is more for other people who might look at posts like this and just feel like they're not committing as much as they need to in order to work in this industry. >bit manipulation, memory management I have no idea how to any of this off the top of my head. I would undoubtedly have to google it, and not once have I ever had to deal with it in my jobs. I'm not great a maths, yet I got the 3rd highest mark in my masters on the topic of machine learning and data mining. I don't "dream and puke code". The amount of times I've had to google "how to declare array java" at work is ridiculous. I admire the amount of work people like OP put in. Google would easily hire him over me any day I'd say. And i'm fine with that. My goal here is just to show to others who may be thinking that they're not good enough or aren't working as hard as OP, that you can absolutely make it in this industry if you're only doing half as much prep as OP. Will a big 4 company hire you? Probably not. But that's ok, there are TONS of other companies that will, and that can offer benefits that would up there with the likes of them. Also as unfair as it may be, it is absolutely true that "it's who you know, not what you know" that gets you work. Yes if you're a top developer you'll obviously stand a great chance of getting a role. But have a friend at a company who's good friends with their manager and can talk you up and give in your cv? He's probably going to get the job. Networking is arguably more important imo. Also soft skills are really important. You might be able to write the most eloquent and efficient code ever, but if you can't work in a team and communicate with the business/clients, you're going to have a rough time.,;/1
train,;/Posts like this always leave me demoralized. I couldn't get into comp science because I am retarded at any math above algebra. I have no problem programming though. I work as a mainframe programmer currently, but I am trying to get into mobile development. I've been breezing through tons of courses without any issues, but I still feel like I know nothing.,;/1
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/>The amount of times I've had to google "how to declare array java" at work is ridiculous. Yup.,;/1
train,;/I really agree with this. Plenty of my friends work in Google and a lot of them aren't the type of people who would even code for fun. They just know the fundamentals of their specialization, work well in a team and seem like good craic over a pint. Feels like fresh grads that take most of their knowledge of the interview process from Reddit will be over-prepared for the technical aspects but could be blindsided by the *just as* important social aspects of an interview.,;/1
train,;/Just want to say it's nice to see you trying to be supportive. Edit 5/7/20: wow that is a lot of upvotes, thanks!,;/1
train,;/More of a relationship advice but you could ask your boyfriend to explain these things to you, you would learn a lot and he would be excited that you're interested in the things that excite and interest him. I would be extremely happy if my partner would be genuinely interested in my hobbies and asked me to explain things.,;/1
train,;/Thank you!,;/2
train,;/I do ask! But he's not very good at explaining and I feel bad for asking nonstop, u actually want to follow up and ask with more advanced questions.,;/1
train,;/super sweet of you, but my opinion sometimes (if you have no real interest in learning it other than for him) it’s better to just listen cause that’s probably all he wants is for someone to listen and to be interested in what he’s saying even if you may not understand the listening is more important than the understanding of it. i’m comparing this to listening to my GF talk about her make up i don’t understand and she’ll stop and say you probably lost and confused about this term or what this product does but she’ll continue like nothing with a big smile on her face because what she really loves is that i’m listening to her interests and asking questions every now and then about stuff i didn’t get.,;/1
train,;/You asking him to explain can be a form of study/learning for him too though. You can both benefit from the questions and answers. To be able to teach any material you need a deeper understanding than it takes to just make use of the knowledge.,;/1
train,;/Him learning to explain complex topics simply would be very valuable careerwise. So the fact that you actually are very interested is good and just asking him to explain more in depth is probably the best way. Alternatively just look up some simple ~10min YouTube videos that gives a decent introduction without being in depth of how it does it i.e. "what is <subject>",;/1

train,;/I am working as web developer (wordpress) for 2 years and I've just promoted myself from total idiot to partial idiot after I learned to add event listeners without jquery. Also I found out yesterday that self closing elements can't have pseudo classes. So, congrats. You made for this.,;/2
train,;/Oh, and more details on how I started here: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/cd5jud/9_months_ago_i_started_learning_front_end/,;/3
train,;/What is your degree?,;/0
train,;/It certainly does help that I worked in sales for 10 years first, there are a ton of soft skills that carry over. It's hard to compare yourself to others. Junior also means very different things in different companies. Don't be too hard on yourself :),;/2
train,;/This is not going to sound comforting but unless you're a consultant or your company requires them, the certs aren't much good. If you're still a junior dev after 4 years then you probably need to start looking at a different company. If you want to stay then it's time to put on your adult pants and have a conversation with your manager. Unless they're absolute garbage, they'll be able to help you develop a plan to migrate from jr to mid within 6 months. I also want to point out that junior, senior, mid level...are really just titles and a senior at one company can barely be mid level at another one. If possible try focusing on the strength of your contributions and the type of projects you work on. The technologies you work with and how well you can explain your contributions and interview will help you get a new job just as much as a certain title.,;/1
train,;/Sounds like you're ready for a new job, buddy.,;/2
train,;/I fucking love the upgrade from “Total idiot to partial idiot” thanks for the chuckle!,;/2
train,;/Degrees of life baby. Lol But seriously, I'm from australia where education is super expensive and there are lots of jobs available, so I got a sales job instead of going to uni.,;/1
train,;/Worked in sales for 10 years before moving into tech. I now live in Berlin. There are lots of start ups here and they are open to giving you a chance if you prove technical skills with portfolios and technical challenges.,;/2
train,;/Thanks for posting this. As I told my students recently, “yes, there are people out there who can easily self train themselves into a six figure programming job. They already did. If you didn’t already do this, you’re not one of them, and that’s fine, they’re extremely rare. Now let’s start learning.”,;/1
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/Yeah I totally see your point. I'm on the side you are describing. I know how to do some coding, I know some java and am learning some Delphi (through job training) Luckily for me, here in Germany, there is a thing called "Ausbildung" which would translate to job training. So over the course of 3 years (or 2 if you are good and get to shorten the training) you learn the craft of your given occupation at a company and only then do you get the title of for example "IT specialist - software development". You get a small salary and you go to a special school. The issue might be that this form of job training doesn't exist in enough places in the world. I'm sure the problem you are describing would diminish greatly if this pathway existed. As job training is basically a professional boot camp regulated by the government.,;/1
train,;/This, absolutely, cannot be impressed upon prospective programming students enough. 2 years ago, looking for a change in career, I was pulled in by the promises of an online coding school and I was given the definite impression that once I had finished a course or two I would be in a prime position to start a career in software development. I spent 6 months or so working through the course materials and It's fair to say that I picked it up pretty quickly and learned a lot about the basic structure and syntax of the language (Python) and potential uses for the language. At this point I started contacting local companies; not to apply for work but to get an idea what they, as employers, would expect me to be able to accomplish on my own if I were to work for them and honestly I was shocked at how much I didn't know. Learning a programming language to an intermediate level is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to being an employable member of a development team. There is an ocean of supporting technologies that as an online student I had never even considered and that the providers I had studied with had barely touched on if at all. Most people I contacted were supportive and quite frank with what I needed to brush up on if I wanted to enter the industry. Learn Linux, Git, basic Networking, AWS, Kubernetes, database types... and the list goes on. I decided that I would need to get my foot in the door of a company and try to work my way into a developer position so long story short, I managed to secure myself an admin role with a local tech startup. I made it clear from my interview that I didn't want to stick in admin forever but was willing to put in the work with the hopes that eventually I could start on a trainee developer position. Once I'd got comfortable in the business I started talking to the devs about opportunities to do small projects for them; homework if you like. So that I could get some real-world experience, putting my coding skills into practice and importantly, showing them that I was willing to put in the effort and that the time they invested in me would return them some value. It's been a great experience and I would say that after two years, from when I first started learning code to now, I feel that I am in a position where I could confidently apply for a junior developer role. It's been hard work though. Working 8 hour days, Monday to Friday, then going home and working on coding projects in the evening. I'd say that in total, with my day job plus projects in the evening I'm doing about 60-70 hours a week in front of a computer (and I still suck at typing). This is something that online schools just don't talk about, in my experience. They give the impression that you pay the fee, watch the videos and come out the other end, a fully-fledged, rockstar coder. I'd encourage anyone to walk this path but its not the easy one that many make it out to be.,;/1
train,;/Yes, I agree. I think that's a spot-on advice and ultimately what I wanted to convey: yes, you want to help them to get there, but let's be realistic and don't underestimate what it takes.,;/1
train,;/That’s one thing people are forgetting. Most of these people transferring to a developer job probably already have their Msc in something else, and are already quite smart,;/1
train,;/I think the original idea was good. Take already-skilled programmers and teach them web dev basics quickly. And people like that probably can learn the most important stuff in 3 months and learn on the job for the rest. The problem is, 3 months is not realistic for someone with no experience. I had lots of prior experience, did a 6 month bootcamp along with lots of self study and it took me a couple months to land a job. And most of the people in my bootcamp are still looking a year later.,;/2
train,;/> you might just ruin the Iowa cacus. Loool. First time I wish I had coins for awards.,;/2
train,;/I fell victim to this logic after hearing from everyone how important it is to code in today's workplace. As a 32 year old with kids and a currently useless business degree it sounded enticing. I grabbed a few books from my local library and went at it. I like to consider myself a fast and thorough learner, I excell in school and have a knack for studying and retaining information. I quickly realized that this would be a long and possibly financially fruitless endeavor as I will likely never become a professional. That said, I enjoyed learning the basics of python and think I will continue to learn simply as a hobby.,;/2
train,;/That's something to keep in mind when people or companies talk about self-taught/no degree. Majority of my coworkers falling into this category either dropped out of CS to start working, or they already have a STEM degree. Most commonly EE or math. Hell, majority of the threads here or on medium spouting the "self taught in X months and got a job" ends up with OP having a STEM degree. Now, plenty of people have succeeded without this obviously. But the competition can be quite fierce and they are like the cream of the crop of self-taught.,;/1
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/Subscribed. Please deliver,;/1
train,;/Cool. What programming language do you plan on using in your videos?,;/0
train,;/> I have met people ... for whom self-balancing search trees are trivial I feel like I have gotten very good at implementing various (relatively) advanced data structures and algos, but I always screw up AVL trees (and similar). I don't know why, but I always have to spend much longer debugging these than other things. I remember my original data structures and algos class in college and I did well on everything except the AVL tree project. Anyway, you just reminded me of my arch-enemy in programming, so I had to rant :P,;/1
train,;/i wanna know this, it's a make or break for me to sub or not.,;/2
train,;/I plan on covering a higher level language but the first ten lessons or so will be computer Science basics because in my opinion, without those well understood, people get confused and give up when more complicated concepts are introduced. I will cover JavaScript to start, then likely switch to java for a bit. My goal is to eventually have a series in java, JavaScript and the whole front-end stack (html, css), sql (either mysql or postgres) and from there do maybe android and iOS too.,;/1
train,;/So long as it's a reasonably popular language, it shouldn't matter. You don't teach someone how to program by taking them through language syntax, you teach them by helping them understand common constructs (loops, Boolean logic, objects) and then how to break problems down into basic elements that can be handled easily with those constructs. Learning a language is just finding out how that language 'does' the things you need it to do.,;/1
train,;/What are AVL trees? More so, what does AVL mean? I have implemented a BST with linked lists, just never heard the AVL term.,;/0
train,;/Here's a thing I think you should cover quickly because as a beginner I still don't know how to get around and would find it incredibly useful - how to actually get a deployable .exe application that actually runs outside of the IDE. I know how to make a window and buttons, how to execute business logic, save to files, yadda yadda, but it all needs to run through my copy of Eclipse every time. I'd love to be able to make something I could take to a freshly installed copy of Windows / Linux / iOS, have a leftclickable shortcut to it on the desktop and it would run with no other setup or tool required. This alone would put your tutorial head and shoulders above the 18425th iteration of an East Indian guy explaining what a String is and how to use for and while loops who keeps on fixing his code while recording and apologizing for fixing his code more than explaining it.,;/1

train,;/I couldn't do my job without the internet. There are way too many things to remember them all. Knowing what it is you need to search for is the hardest part though.,;/1

train,;/I had a client ask me something similar once, and I said "Wouldn't you want bridge builders to use calculators?" to which he ate a nice slice of humble pie.,;/1
train,;/Wow that's crazy, there's just so much to technology these days no one is expected to remember everything. With that said, he's not paying to read a guide, he's paying you to understand and also trouble shoot if the guide doesn't work. Someone blindly following a guide could end up reading that "rm -rf /" will fix all your problems and actually do it! :D,;/1
train,;/Sometimes, all that you need to do is know that a tool or concept exists. Don't exhaust yourself trying to remember the ins-&-outs of one thing, when you can do a quick search to fill in the blanks, and use that extra mental storage capacity that you've saved to remember more technologies and principles.,;/1
train,;/which is the beauty of specific error codes i love it when i get a clear error code i can copy paste into google to tell me wtf is wrong rather than having to google "this problem with this program on this os" lol,;/1

train,;/Who were you DenverCoder9? What did you see?,;/0
train,;/> You’ll be doing a lot more reading than writing most of the time. You are correct. Unfortunately when candidates interviewed for jobs, most of the time they are asked to write code, not reading/debugging code. At least that's what I experienced in my career. That's why when I was hiring people, I asked them to read a design doc, then read a source code and asked them to talk about it.,;/1
train,;/For every line of code you write, you're going to be reading 5 more. And then reading them 5 more times, and then rewriting it for more efficiency then repeating that process until forever.,;/1
train,;/And then when you learn to read code, learn to recognize the code that is read easily from the code that isn't. If you can recognize code that is hard to read, you'll recognize when you're writing it. This is very important because in 6 weeks, you'll be trying to read it to figure out what the fuck it does.,;/1
train,;/Errors and stack traces as well. They're trying to help you figure out what went wrong. Don't ignore them.,;/1
train,;/> That's why when I was hiring people, I asked them to read a design doc, then read a source code and asked them to talk about it. Hey can you go into more detail about this? Thank you in advance!,;/1
train,;/It's not forever, it's just until you either cash out on some big stock options or die.,;/2
train,;/It could be like a debugging session, where the candidate needs to understand a short excerpt of a spec, then find bug(s) in the code that causes the software does not behave per spec. Or it could be as simple as asking them to find where a certain section of spec/design implemented in the source code. I'm in embedded sw development, so a lot in the spec involves HW registers etc. A good candidate is usually comfortable in reading a design doc, and browse through the source code and directory structure. Often in my field, there's no official training other than learning by comparing design doc and implementation. If you are unlucky, the document is scarce and/or the code is poorly commented. I usually give them access to all the tools they need including the compiler, editors of their choice and they are allowed to Google stuff. Basically they would do the things they would do in their first weeks of the job.,;/1
train,;/most likely die,;/2
train,;/I hope you advertise this. Any dev I know would love to work for such a company.,;/2
train,;/Unfortunately, it's not a company thing. Each hiring manager, even interviewers have different standard. It's pretty tricky to balance between giving the team members latitude to gauge their future peers while keeping the interview questions relevant. Interviewing candidate is a tricky business, we want to set the filter just right so that we don't get false positive or false negative. Big companies like Google, FB, Microsoft etc. have luxury to set the high bar to avoid false positive. There will be a lot of false negative, but they can afford it because they get hundreds if not thousands of resumes everyday.,;/1
train,;/Looks like a lot of really great resources, but it kinda bugs me that it says "Full Stack Web Development" when this doesn't include any resources for ( or even any mention of ) Back-end Languages, Databases, Server Administration, etc. The "Full Stack" in "Full Stack Developer" generally means *everything* that makes up the full web stack, not just the front end. Perhaps it should be renamed to "100+ Free resources for learning **Front End** Web Development." For someone getting started, this seems misleading to exclude at least some mention that all of these resources only focus on the front end. Edit: since posting this comment, looks like some node resources were added. It's a start.,;/1
train,;/> 18 months ago I dove head first into Full Stack Web Development. And what are your results in that timeframe?,;/0
train,;/I'm not OP, but I can provide my own experience. I went from knowing nothing about programming, to having built two full web apps (Twitter clone and Instagram clone), and my first client as a freelancer in about 11 months. I would say I put in about 20 hours a week (sometimes less and sometimes more of course), and by the end I was at the point where I was pretty confident in my skills (this fades over time, you go from knowing nothing, to knowing everything, to knowing nothing again. This is just the natural progression. Obviously you continuously know more stuff, it's just the scope of what you can know, and what you want to know grows too.). The key is to do *something* EVERY day. Try to do at least an hour every day, but even all you can do is 20 minutes, do that, make it a habit. This is not the kind of skill you can cram in your head by doing 10 hours once a week. Also, copy EVERYTHING you read (code-wise at least). Copy every code sample, and do every practice problem. The saying "you can read every book about swimming, understand every word, but you'll probably drown first time you jump in pool". Programming is the same thing. You get good by actually doing it, the reading/tutorials/articles/etc. just introduce new ideas and steps of what to practice and try. The key skills of a programmer is as much about knowing how to know something, as it is about knowing something. By that I mean, I don't know everything there is to know about the languages and frameworks I use, I know a fair amount, but I know how to find the information and tools I need, very quickly. In web development, you'll often be doing something that's totally new to you, so you'll need to have the confidence to break it down, find information online, determine if it's quality or not, use parts of it that are good, discard parts that are outdated, fill in the gaps, etc. The other key things is to pick one thing and stick to it. ONE type of programming (games, web, embedded, etc.) ONE language. ONE framework. ONE text editor. Until I got to the point where I was confident at solving problems with code in one language, EVERY single second I spent trying to learn another language was sort of wasted. You *will* be tempted to try Vim/Sublime/an IDE, or learning some C/Assembly/etc. (assuming that they weren't your initial choice of what to learn), but don't give in to temptation, yet, there will be plenty of time later on. That's not to say you shouldn't know some basic concepts in C just because you're learning Python, for example. It can help, but don't spend much time on it, read an article or two, or a StackOverflow thread, but don't go diving into a tutorial/book about it. You'd be better off getting comfortable in one thing first, it'll give you a better context to put things in. Really what I mean is, don't try to learn half of Ruby/Rails, then half of Python/Django, then half of C++/Gaming, etc. Learn one from front to back (you'll realize you can never really know it front to back totally, at least not in a year or two). One good way to do this is to pick a big end goal, like "I want to build a website that does X, Y and Z", "I want to build a clone of Facebook", "I want to create a game like Zelda", etc. And keep going until you accomplish that, but make sure you are not just accomplishing that goal, but understanding *how* it works. I can teach you how to make a Facebook clone in less than an hour. Google "facebook clone github", find one on Github, figure out the language/framework used, get it running locally, done. But that totally does *not* count. That's cheating. You want to make sure that *every* line of code was written by you (even if some might have been copied from StackOverflow or GitHub, that's ok, but NEVER NEVER NEVER copy/paste while you're learning, TYPE IT, type it all). And make sure that you understand everything you wrote, you can copy, but make sure you type it, and make sure you know what it does, why it fixes your problem. Do you need to copy all of it, or just part of it. Do their variable names make sense in your code, or should you change them? Again, don't fall into the trap of being the StackOverflow/GitHub copy/paste programmer, who doesn't know *why* it all works, they just know that somewhere in the 10-15 chunks of code they copied, it did the thing they wanted it to, but had they taken the time to actually *learn* it, they could have done it in a few lines of beautiful and easy to maintain code. And above all, don't beat yourself up, or get hung up if you don't understand something. Read it again, look at other resources explaining it, sleep on it, move on, go back to it, move on again. Eventually things will fall into place, but not always in the order you are introduced to them. To begin with, there's going to be a lot of times when you're doing something or typing something, that you have no idea what it's doing. I said to type everything, and know what you're typing, but sometimes you won't know at the point where you type it, just make sure that the parts you didn't understand when you copied them, you go back to, and I bet by the time you go back a day or week or month later, you'll know it, but make sure you *do* go back, because if you don't understand it yet, hop on Google and try again. Programming can't be learned totally linearly. Some things need to exist, but be unknown, to create the environment to learn about something else. But don't worry, things will fall into place, it takes time. It takes everyone time to learn, it's a huge amount of stuff to learn, but it's really not all that complex, it's just a ton of things. I always get annoyed when people don't want to learn programming because "I'm not a genius or good at math". There's no single concept anywhere near as complicated as something you learned in HS algebra class. Programming is like learning to build/fix a car engine, no single part is too complex for every human to understand, there's just lot of parts, and they all fit together in lots of different ways (except programming is like a car but with orders of magnitude more parts/connections/concepts. You'll one day give up on the idea of knowing everything, because it's just not possible. You can't even know what was done before you, and things are growing ahead of you faster than you can learn them too, but don't worry, just focus on a goal, and keep doing a bit everyday). TL;DR If you know nothing about programming, and you dedicate 15-20 hours a week(make sure you do some every day), you should be pretty comfortable in one language/framework in 10-12 months or less. That's not to say you'd be a senior developer in that language, more like struggling to be a junior dev, but you'd be able to take any idea you can think of, and break it down into solvable units that you'd know how to solve, and that's really all programming is. EDIT: sorry for my horrific grammar. English is my first language, I just usually type something completely different than what my brain is thinking.,;/1
train,;/Dude, great post and great recommendations! Thanks ClemDev,;/1
train,;/> Programming can't be learned totally linearly. Some things need to exist, but be unknown, to create the environment to learn about something else. But don't worry, things will fall into place, it takes time. It takes everyone time to learn, it's a huge amount of stuff to learn, but it's really not all that complex, it's just a ton of things. I want to print this out and hang it above my monitor. Thanks for putting things in perspective.,;/1
train,;/>even if some might have been copied from StackOverflow or GitHub, that's ok, but NEVER NEVER NEVER copy/paste while you're learning, TYPE IT, type it all Man oh man. I teach a couple of programming boot camps to teens over the summers and I start every session with a discussion about this. The online tool we use gives a lot of code and it's tempting to copy/paste but it is so important to type it yourself. Type it in line by line, analyze it, understand it. Make sure you know why that line exists, figure out what it does. Predict what would go wrong if it weren't there. SO. IMPORTANT.,;/1
train,;/That got me so motivated... thank you! On the other hand... learning one language is hard, while your in the IT high school. School wants me to learn PHP(+SQL), JS, C++ and Java at the same time. This is insane, we're not learning programming, we're learning languages.,;/1
train,;/LOL Back in 1983 my friends father sat me down at a PC and handed me IIRC PC Magazine. There was a feature in there about learning to program. I would diligently type line by line, compile...and nothing. You'd have to wait for next months issue for all the typos and corrections from the previous month. It turned me off of programming, though years later I worked with a lot of programmers at a tech company. I went another route and decided, everything breaks..so I'll learn how to fix it. I don't have the patience for programming so kudo's to all of you.,;/1
train,;/That isn't necessarily bad. Each one has its own thing. You will learn object oriented which is pivotal. Then you learn your web from PHP. and sql. And it's school so they are meant to get you interested in things. And learn GIT, it is extremely important,;/2

train,;/To all those who are asking how he learned! and those who cant wait till morning. I've seen this guy a few months back. He studied the free Harvard's CS50 intro computer science first Then continued his path on IOS programming by learning Swift. Your welcome.,;/1
train,;/How did you learn? What projects did you do?,;/0
train,;/Congrats man!! Do you mind sharing the different resources you went through and your programming journey? If not, no mind. Congrats again and proud of you!,;/0
train,;/Posted and ghosted us =( EDIT: Nevermind he is here! Sorry,;/2
train,;/This is more or less what my programming path looked like: **July 2020:** I was on LinkedIn looking for civil engineerings jobs, when I came across a post about a company in my area that was looking for front end developers. I was curious as to what that was, so i clicked on it and saw that they needed someone who knew HTML, CSS and Javascript. I thought it looked interested so I came to reddit to look for resources to learn programming. Here, I saw that the community was basically talking about three main web development courses: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), [The Essential Web Development course on Upskill](https://upskillcourses.com/courses), and [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Like every beginner I wanted to try all of them at the same time, so I spent a couple of weeks trying them out to see which one I liked better. **August 2020:** After finishing the HTML and CSS section in FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. I learned about [Harvard's CS50](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) course and decided to give it a shot since people were highly recommending it. This was also when I lost motivation to continue with The Odin Project because I was getting stuck in the Sketch & Etch project. (Had I continued the web developer path, I would have gone back to that project as I later learned that getting stuck is part of being a programmer). I felt like I was doing way too many courses, and I wanted to avoid being stuck in tutorial hell, so I decided to also drop FreeCodeCamp and focus on Harvard's CS50 and Upskill's Web Development course. **September 2020:** I'd say that during September, I had three different projects going on for me: I was doing the Upskill course and learning how to build websites using Ruby on Rails, I was learning C through Harvard's CS50, and I was creating an imaginary website using what I had learned with HTML and CSS. I was still interested in going the Web Developer course. **October 2020:** At the beginning of October, a friend put me in touch with a friend of his that had an app development company. The guy was very nice and seemed interested in hiring me, but he said that he was looking for someone who knew Swift, and told me that if I managed to learned Swift, he would for sure hire me. Luckily, I wasn't dead set in following the web development path. I'd say I was still finding my way into programming. So after this person told me that I'd had a job opportunity if I learned Swift, I dove right into iOS Development. I stopped doing the Upskill course, but I was finding the Harvard course so helpful that I decided to finish it since I saw that for the final project, there was an option to do an iOS app. This is where I learned about [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) and [Angela Yu's iOS Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/). I did the first 15 days of Hacking with Swift 100 days course, which basically taught me the basics of the Swift language, and then I bought Angela Yu's course. **November 2020:** My time was divided between doing Harvard course and Angela's course on Udemy. **December 2020:** My goal was to finish both courses by the end of the year, and I'm happy to say that I accomplished just that. After having gotten a good grasp of the Swift language, I contacted the guy who told me I should learn Swift and he told me that in January he would send me a sort of challenge project so I could see what I had learned during those last couple of months. **January 2020:** I spent the majority of January working on the Test Project that this person gave me, while also continuing with the Hacking with Swift course.,;/3
train,;/I second this!! :),;/2
train,;/The secret to programming is TIME. There's no shortcut. If you invest TIME, you will learn and get better. But sitting down every day and spending 1 or 2 hours learning for months, takes enormous discipline. It doesn't matter which of the 10 million instructional pages or courses or YouTube videos you do. Just pick something, stick with it, and throw a lot of TIME into it.,;/1
train,;/U are a complete beginner and I wonder how do you learn Ruby, C and HTML,CSS at the same time? Not to mention that you moved on to Swift in the following month. That's just sound too much things to learn in such a short span of time,;/0
train,;/Not OP, however it sounds like he didn't have any employment during the ~6mo of learning, and if he put in 60hrs a week (a lot, but very achievable with no other commitments) then that's around ~1500 hours of learning. That is a lot, about half of my university degree in six months (~1000hrs/yr of learning, for three years). If your focus is only on developing skills directory related to employment, then that is well within reach and you will be able to learn a lot in that amount of time.,;/1
train,;/Not to forget that he had been working in another job for some years probably which may have given him some background to grasp things a bit easier. In the end, the more concrete your goals are, the easier you can prepare for them or work towards them. But just guessing 🤷‍♂️,;/2
train,;/As a beginner programmer, this helps so much with connecting the dots between concepts. Job well done!,;/1
train,;/This will need a Random button at some point. Not really enough definitions to warrant it yet, but hopefully it'll get there.,;/1
train,;/Added the obligatory recursion -> recursion for you,;/1
train,;/Cool concept. Just watch out so that it doesn't go Urban Dictionary's own way and people start inserting their individual random made-up terminology.,;/1
train,;/If you want some content for it you could always port the [jargon file](http://catb.org/jargon/html/) into it.,;/1
train,;/Good job Reddit, we hugged it to death.,;/2
train,;/Thank you so much! I struggled (and still often struggle) with this, and that was exactly the inspiration for the app.,;/1
train,;//u/Vandechoz - excellent idea - this is now a live feature, thanks to you! ~~Great idea!~~,;/2
train,;/That was one of my true moments of joy with google as I often misspell things. so it suggests "did you mean Recursion" And of course i clicked on it. page reloads... Did you mean Recursion? Why yes I did. Click. I honestly clicked about 3-4 times before I asked myself how google can misspell things and took a closer look.,;/2
train,;/I think Reddit accidentally DDoS'd your site because too many people are trying to view it at once, and now I don't understand what I just wrote since I have no way to look up what DDoS means,;/2
train,;/I finished this a couple of weeks ago and I honestly think it’s great. I started using the stuff I learned straight away because the examples you work through are genuinely useful and can be used for all sorts of different things. (I promise this isn’t Al using another account),;/1
train,;/Just signed up. I love that there are real-world examples in the course to help you learn pragmatic ways of using the language. Too often do I see online courses basically teach you the basics of a language, then leave you to figure out how/when to utilize what you've been taught. But courses that have you learn through *doing* will always be my go-to. Looking forward to taking this!,;/1
train,;/Al, are you serious? for a single mom of 3. thank you thank you thank you! i have been eying this for months!!!! And exactly what I will need.,;/1

train,;/Hey Al. Thanks again for making this as accessible as possible. What's the status of the upgrade of this course to the ATBS 2e material? I know you said it will take some time. Just curious how far along you are. Edit: Nevermind. Apparently, I can't read. Thanks for the update.,;/0

train,;/oh you gottem good. oof,;/2
train,;/And a year of unemployment,;/2
train,;/My fear of being shit on and beaten up for asking intermediate questions of beginner level experts is what kept me stupid for a long time.,;/1
train,;/I started a new job recently. Everyone working remotely. I spent 4 hours trying to fix something before finally asking for help (because I thought it was something I should know). Turns out our senior dev of almost 20 years didn’t know either. Need to swallow your pride more and just ask for help / to be pointed in the right direction with certain tasks.,;/1
train,;/"Interrupt other coders who seem too preoccupied"... No. Don't do this, at least not in this way. Politely send a slack or DM if they look busy, otherwise just wait until they aren't deep in thought. You don't want to make enemies,;/1
train,;/Please don’t interrupt coders who are busy. “The Zone” is very real and you are just going to annoy people. Send them a message asking when they’re free and then go talk to them.,;/1
train,;/Could this this be unique to United States? I was unafraid to ask questions until I came here, but it could be due to my language barrier at the times. But I have noticed that even American borns are afraid to ask questions in fear of looking stupid. I had to get it off my chest and ask.,;/0
train,;/But also, **please do this** if you're really blocked. When someone interrupts me, and I'm really occupied, I'll politely let them know that I'll get back to you. Most senior engineers aren't so socially inept and petty that they'll snap at you for interrupting them. The real issue in this industry isn't juniors who are overly dependent on others and require constant hand-holding. Just the opposite, almost every new grad I mentor these days are too afraid to actually ask for help for fear of sounding incompetent or they just don't want to "upset the gray-beards". It's so much easier for me to set a person straight if they're overly reliant on me for help for even the most trivial things (usually a 1-1 does the job), but managing someone who doesn't let up when they're stuck is much more high maintenance for me. I think many senior engineers here would also agree with this sentiment, have common sense when reaching out for help (and it's our job to set those expectations), but if you're on the edge between asking and not asking, know that our lives are easier if you ask more often than you don't.,;/1
train,;/Also, make sure the answer isn't just the first result on google/stack overflow, or if the answer there still doesn't make sense include a link to that answer. If gives the person helping you a starting point and context to what you're asking and shows that you at least tried something on your own first.,;/1
train,;/It also helps to think to yourself "What do I think they will say?". This has caused me less embarrassment by making me search real hard for the answer myself before asking someone else.,;/1
train,;/My wife does this sometimes and it kills me. I’ll be literally in the flow zone, ideas linking together with little to no effort, having an amazing time. And she’ll come down to my office and start asking questions about this and that... then I lose my *entire* train of thought... like, I love her to death, but that irks me.,;/2
train,;/I agree with this. Personnaly before asking a question I write my question with many details (from where I started to my problem, why I have this problem, what I tried and why It doesn't work) on note and usually by tiping my question I find the solution of my problem.,;/2

train,;/You're welcome.,;/2
train,;/As a heads up: you have obviously *linked to* (in your explanations - by posting the full target domain even if it is not as link) to a banned domain (linksynergy) and the reddit spam filter caught that. That's the reason why it came up as removed. Another mod has seen that post and has approved it - that's why it shows up now. Sorry for the delay and thanks for doing this!,;/1
train,;/Lol Well, at least we know the filter is working. You're welcome. And thanks for keeping the sub running!,;/1

train,;/I finally gave the whole video a watch, and looked ahead at the other videos in the series.

train,;/I used to watch his videos on YouTube and thought he was very funny but later on I couldn't discern if he was sarcastic or just being an absolute jerk, but apparently judging by the comments on his channel everyone "got him" except myself. So I so I drifted off his content and thought it was me only that had an issue. I prefer channels like Forrest Knight's, it's less about him and more about CS.,;/1
train,;/I can't take a guy seriously who rambles about software development in each video without showing any relevant code. From what I've observed, he does not have any public repositories to his name, and in my opinion, is not able to demonstrate any experience. Heck, I truly doubt that he even participated in the development of AlgoPro. Edit: On top of that, a person naming his videos "Why I am richer than you", should be avoided in general.,;/1
train,;/Holy shit, I fucking knew it. I knew this guy was bad but every time I went into the comment section it was all positive in his videos. He doesn’t seem like a very intelligent person, he seems like a hack.,;/1
train,;/> That guy is a prick I watched a couple of his videos and couldn't figure out if his arrogance was real or just put on for the videos. But either way I found it really annoying and stopped watching. Then I see a video titled, "How I spend $1 000 000 income a year, as a millionaire". and just shake my head....."Fired from Facebook for having a Youtube channel". <--- over a million views,;/1
train,;/>multi-millionaire From his Twitter bio. I think it says volumes when somebody feels the need to promote their self-worth in monetary terms.,;/1
train,;/He was being super arrogant about open source in one of his videos and he basically said oss is shit bc you don't get paid, and he would never do oss.,;/1
train,;/He's smart enough to know that in life, self promotion gets you farther than raw intelligence.,;/1
train,;/Always thought he was trolling.,;/1
train,;/I only watched a handful of his videos, from which all have been just disgusting.Calling OSS shit is just plain stupid in my opinion. Developer or not, we all use software which is open source on a daily basis, and I have yet to meet someone who has something bad to say about it. That is just pure BS. If he does not like OSS, for that matter he should just go ahead and use proprietary, non-free stuff then. I know that he made a video about how he was praising Mac and talking random shit about Linux. I guess he wouldn't have done that if he knew that the Darwin kernel, from which his "ultimate" operating system is based on, is OSS. And it comes from the UNIX kernel family. Edit: Just realized that LinkedIn does not moderate if your stated work experience on your profile is legit or not, so since he never came up with any proof that he actually was a tech lead in Google or Facebook, I am starting to doubt those "facts" as well.

train,;/It was like the bloopers at the end of the movie,;/2
train,;/It has factorial time complexity. So it will take *very very* long time ...,;/1
train,;/I'm partial to Radix sort, I like how it looks like it's not doing anything until the very end, and then sounds quite nice.,;/2
train,;/There are a few variables to consider. * How large is your data set * How sorted is your data set already * What is the data set structure * How constrained are you cpu/memory resources Generally speaking quicksort is going to be your quickest and most efficient sort. But in the cases where you hit the worst case scenario it's very slow. Merge sort is a great runner up, but a bit of a resource hog. When you *really* require it, the best sorting algorithm is one that is written specifically for the datasets you're trying to sort, but it requires the overhead of creating that algorithm.

train,;/> U.S. Customs allowed him into the country after officials called Andela and First Access to corroborate his story. Which is what they should have done in the first place. Instead, they thought it would be appropriate to drill a Javascript programmer on a data structure and traversal algorithm more appropriate for C/C++/Java developers.,;/1
train,;/For those who refuse to sell their souls to LinkedIn: # A software engineer is detained for several hours by U.S. Customs — and given a test to prove he’s an engineer By Caroline Fairchild Celestine Omin was accustomed to tackling tough engineering problems. Just not the two that the Border Agent had put in front of his face — or at least not now, after having spent 24 hours cramped in an economy seat on Qatar Airways. It was Sunday, Feb. 26 and the 28-year-old software engineer had left his home in Lagos, Nigeria, to come to the United States for the first time. It was a work trip. For the last six months, Omin had been working for Andela, a startup that connects the top tech talent in Africa with employers in the U.S. Andela accepts less than 1% of applicants into its program and is backed by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan. For this particular role, Omin was helping NYC-based fintech startup First Access create a JavaScript application for emerging markets and had secured a short-term visa. After landing, Omin waited for 20 minutes and then reached the front of the line, where a Customs and Border Protection officer asked him a series of questions. It was here that Omin realized that the job might be challenging, but getting into America could now be impossible. No one at Andela had prepared him for the new reality. After a few minutes of grilling him about the job, the border agent escorted Omin into a small room and told him to sit down. Another hour passed before a different customs officer came in. “Your visa says you are a software engineer. Is that correct?” the officer asked Omin in a tone the engineer described as accusatory. When Omin said it was right, the officer presented him with a piece of paper and a pen and told him to answer the following questions: “Write a function to check if a Binary Search Tree is balanced.” “What is an abstract class, and why do you need it?” To Omin — who now hadn’t slept in more than 24 hours — the questions seemed opaque and could have multiple answers. While he is a skilled software engineer with more than seven years of experience, Omin later tells me that the questions looked to him like someone with no technical background Googled something like, “Questions to ask a software engineer.” (The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency did not respond to multiple requests for comment made by LinkedIn over phone and email by the time this story went to press.) With no context or guidelines on how to answer the questions, Omin, “too tired to even think,” sat down and tried his best. But when he handed his answers back after about 10 minutes of work, the official told him his answers were wrong. “No one would tell me why I was being questioned,” Omin told me by phone. “Every single time I asked [the official] why he was asking me these questions, he hushed me… I wasn’t prepared for this. If I had known this was happening beforehand, I would have tried to prepare." “That is when I thought I would never get into the United States,” he told me with noticeable fear in his voice. Omin tells me that the answers to the questions were technically correct, but he suspects the customs official interrogating him wasn’t technically trained and couldn’t understand his answers. More time passed, and Omin started to mentally prepare to get on a plane back to Nigeria. Then — with little explanation — the official told him he was free to go. “He said, ‘Look, I am going to let you go, but you don’t look convincing to me,’” Omin said. “I didn’t say anything back. I just walked out.” Omin later learned that U.S. Customs allowed him into the country after officials called Andela and First Access to corroborate his story. Jeremy Johnson, the co-founder and CEO of Andela, said that his co-founder Christina Sass was the one to receive the call to defend Omin. Just last year, Andela placed more than 100 developers from Africa as full-time software engineers with U.S. tech companies. This is the first time that any of them have ever been grilled with questions specific to software engineering or their particular trade. “Celestine was the first software engineer at one of the most visible e-commerce sites in Africa and is exactly the kind of person we want coming to America and sharing his skills,” said Johnson, who was named to LinkedIn’s Next Wave last year. “Tapping into brilliant minds like Celestine’s is a huge help to many American companies who are struggling to find talent.” For every web developer looking for work in the United States, there are roughly five open positions. That’s why startups like Andela exist in the first place: To connect foreign tech workers with opportunities here in the United States. But now with his partners having a hard time getting into the country to work, Johnson is worried that he might have challenges in the future. He has already reached out to Customs and Border Protection for further clarification on why Omin’s work visa was flagged, but he hasn’t heard back yet. “We seek to play by the rules, but we can’t respond to rules that are ad hoc,” Johnson said. “We want to make sure that our team members around the world know what to prepare for and don’t get unnecessarily hassled for their work.” As for Omin, he says the experience hasn’t changed how he feels about the United States. A proud Nigerian who recently became a father, he is eager to continue to use his tech background to create growth for his country. That said, he was initially concerned about going public with his experience because he's worried he'll be added to a watch list of travelers and have trouble entering the U.S. in the future. “I have been trying to focus here, and I haven’t thought about what is going to happen when I go back to the airport,” he said. “I am coming here legally with good intentions, and I hope to continue this work.” Chip Cutter contributed reporting to this article. Update: This story has been updated to clarify how Andela matches foreign tech workers with jobs in the U.S.,;/2

train,;/Is it odd that I've never really struggled with the difference between a reference and a actual value. I mean if you've ever "referred" to something in a conversation it's the same concept no?,;/0
train,;/A reference, like many other things, is a value. So in a pass-by-value language (like Java or many others), you can pass that value. It isn't that complicated to keep straight as long as you don't conflate two separate issues: * what a reference type is * how function/method/whatever parameters work Reference types still behave as references even when no parameter passing is involved. If, in the same scope, you create two references to the same object and use one to modify it, your changes will be visible when you use the other reference. Within a function, parameters that happen to be a reference type still behave like any other pass-by-value parameter. If you overwrite the parameter (itself!), it won't have any effect on the caller. (And if you use the reference to modify the object, the changes will be visible to the caller. But that would be true in a pass-by-reference language too, so whether it's a pass-by-value or pass-by-reference language has no relevance there. So again the issues are separate.),;/1

train,;/As a rule I've been saying for a long time that if someone wanted to pay me appropriately to learn Cobol and their archaic legacy system I happily will do so. I'm certainly not going to learn a technology that very likely would not further my career and has no use to me on my own, only for you to probably still refuse to hire me, or offer me some paltry salary that is no more then what I make working with less stressful technologies. (Of which, when I took a job at a Mac focused company that wrote their code in ObjectiveC, they did not demand that I knew it before hand. That isn't abnormal to have training for less popular stacks. Cobol goes further in that Cobol necessitates hazard pay. I'm also probably going to fight to do the BARE MINIMUM maintenance changes in order to keep the system operational and try to put more effort on understanding and preparing for replacement.,;/1
train,;/So they're looking for volunteers, not paid workers? And even if they did pay workers, it probably wouldn't be very much?,;/1
train,;/There are plenty of COBOL programmers. The problem is that they are all old and nobody hires old programmers even for old programming languages. I am a old programmer.

train,;/Why? Now is a good time to replace those outdated systems, just like the race to solve y2k saw a lot of antiquated systems mothballed. We should do the same here. Its not that COBOL is complex it isn't: it's mostly some conditional and looping logic and decimal arithmetic. However, most mainframe COBOL programs aren't just COBOL: the COBOL just wraps around macros for accessing databases or interacting with the teleprocessing environment (which queued up the inputs from the terminals, dispatched the appropriate bits of code and then returned the output from the right work unit to the right terminal). Depending on the age of the application, there's probably more of a requirement to understand CICS or IMS. That's where the expertise is likely to be thinner on the ground and you ain't googling many answers.,;/1
train,;/My first IT job I was paid for 3 month RPG langue training (some other language from the COBOL era). Of 6 people in the course, only me and another where good enough to get the job. At the end of the trial 6 months, I already had another job lined up. Not worth the frustration.,;/2

They would literally have no clue that their software is being used in that way. Our company is a vendor too so we can still claim we don't actively accelerate climate change. Also most O&G companies don't develop their own stuff, they get 3rd parties or vendors to implement new technologies.,;/1

train,;/It's not certain legal ground since it hasn't been tested very many times, but there have been cases where GPL licence violations were successfully challenged in civil court after informal resolutions failed. The gpl-violations.org project has notable victories against D-Link and Fortinet. The Free Software Foundation has enforced GPL compliance with Cisco, as well. It seems like MIT and BSD licences could carry similar legal weight. As far as knowing how their software is being used, it's possible that the violation may never be discovered. A lot of companies won't want to take that chance though.,;/2
train,;/That's a tough one to reconcile, but personally, I'm leaning in favour of the climate licence. I agree strongly with the ideals that free software aims to achieve, but at the same time, I can't escape a sense of responsibility if work I do expands human suffering.,;/1
train,;/It's great that people want to help OSS projects, but I don't think 'raiding' is a great framework for doing so. Regarding feature patches: no decent programmer is going to commit a big patch without first understanding it, vetting it for bugs, architectural compatibility and consistency with the project's long-term goals. So factor in a wait of a few weeks just to get your patch examined. A patch written by someone unfamiliar with the codebase is highly unlikely to be accepted first go. You'll be asked to justify choices, and might be asked to rewrite the patch. Will you be around to do this? Regarding bug fixes: if a bug report exists in a bug database, very likely the project owner has seen it. That means it probably isn't 'shallow' or easy to fix. Probably it requires some architectural rethought. This requires deep grokking of the codebase, which 'raiders ' are unlikely to have. See also my previous point about the difficulty of getting such changes in. > people without the technical skills required could participate by providing documentation Good tech writing is IMO harder than coding. It requires intimate familiarity with the software, a broad knowledge of what docs are _already_ out there, an understanding of where users are coming from, and good writing skills. Very few people have that combination of experience, user empathy, technical and writing skills. What are a gaggle of newbies likely to produce? Most likely, bad documentation, which in my view is worse than _no_ documentation. IMHO, if you want to help with coding, recognise that OSS projects are about people as much as about the codebase, and that code without a maintainer is worthless. Stick with a project and really learn how it works. Do the hard yards of earning the trust of the maintainers, and become a commiter. If you want to improve the docs, write blog posts documenting your experiences. It helps users while being clearly unofficial. If your posts get popular enough the contents can be rolled into the official docs.,;/1
train,;/What? One night a month? I need at least few days just to 'get into' the project: to get familiar with building process and code base. And I need to do that before I do anything. And I'm not even lacking "technical skills", in fact I think I'm pretty good at working with unfamiliar projects and my co-workers are often surprised with how fast I can track something in the unfamiliar code bases. Understand me correctly, I think helping open source projects is a wonderful idea, but I think that useful help can come only from people who are familiar enough with the project. Doing something in one night is ridiculous. Make it at least a week. It depends one size of project, bigger projects need more time to get familiar with it. My friend spent many weeks just trying to build and understand Mozilla Firefox. And he is not some random dude -- he was being specially picked by the Mozilla Foundation from Google Summer of Code applicants to help with Firefox. And even then, doing everything in an organized way he still was mis-fortunate to introduce significant regression with his patch on critical vulnerability -- patch fixed the vulnerability, but have broken many sites. So I think doing short raids will do more harm then good. Please reconsider time frame.,;/1
train,;/>Would anyone be interested? Yep.,;/1
train,;/one night a month? can you really fix much with that kind of hit-and-run approach?,;/0
train,;/Haha, this sounds like a pretty cool idea. :D,;/2
train,;/As we have learned from the rally and other occasions, hordes of redditors can accomplish great things. Let's make the open source world a better - and slightly weirder - place!,;/2
train,;/Well, the details are entirely up for discussion. Maybe 2 days is more appropriate. But more likely it would need to be determined for how long it goes on a raid-to-raid basis or just for however long people want to. People will probably also stick with some projects after a raid, because they liked it. In the end it'll all come down to the raid organization, including write-ups on how to get going, giving people specific tasks and communication with the original project maintainers. Just having a bunch of people mindlessly hacking away for such a short time probably won't achieve much, but with good team efforts and structure you can do a lot.,;/2
train,;/If we planned out the project and assigned bugs beforehand, I think it would be very doable. Edit: what maritz said.,;/2
train,;/I was thinking the same thing. Maybe we could extend the "night" to a couple of days, or maybe even a week. I guess it would also depend on the project: if small, a night would be rather sufficient; if big, it could take up to a week for the entire "horde" to coordinate well enough to make a noticeable difference. Anyway, I'm up for it. While not a professional, I can do some coding and could help with translation and other stuff.,;/2
train,;/hmm.. i guess i can see that, and i suppose it depends on the project, but i can see you maybe fixing some low-hanging fruit (bug-fixes, simple ui changes, adding some documentation, etc), but to make a dent in any large project, or major feature changes? i would think it'd take on the order of weeks of dedicated work. Investigate the code-base, get to understand, how it works, what it does, why it does it, etc. Understand the feature you want to add, write the code, get it reviewed by the maintainer(s), fix any issues they have, etc. That said, i don't mean to dissuade you, i'm sure there are *LOTS* of projects who'd like people to clear off some of the low-hanging fruit.,;/1
train,;/It makes sense to me. Code is rarely trying to convey an idea to someone who reads it, instead it is like looking at meshing gears in a machine. It also makes sense it would use the same region used for puzzles. Many people describe coding as a puzzle and are drawn to it because of that. I'd be interested if, as they mention, the region changes with experience, but also if it changes between various languages, i.e. one that is prose-like vs use that uses lots of symbols.,;/2
train,;/What is the last time you sat down by your fireplace on a cold winter evening and read a good program? For me it was a long, long time ago, reading the source for Unix v6 ... never happened again.,;/0
train,;/tl;dr reading code is not like reading English and not like doing maths. It is its own discipline. Surprise, surprise!,;/2
train,;/I've seen studies shared that say language skills are a better indicator of a good programmer than math skills are. I definitely think language is important. I wouldn't say reading code is like reading a book though. I can speed read text. Code though, that is something different. Code is logic. Code doesn't express a thought like this sentence does. It expresses logic in instructions.,;/1
train,;/Group 1: "It's a language problem for the brain!" Group 2: "It's a math problem for the brain!" Brains: "shit this is hard",;/2
train,;/I don’t really agree with code rarely trying to convey an idea. Often, code is written to follow a common pattern which will convey an idea of its purpose to the reader. It’s part of what makes code easy or hard to read.,;/2
train,;/I think programming compared to language and math is apples vs oranges vs berries. Three separate things. It’s a false dichotomy to just say one predicts programming skill and one doesn’t, or even to say one is more predictive than the other. Language and math can both mean many things too. Language: foreign language knowledge, essay writing experience, analytic philosophy studies? Math: logic, calculus, algebra, financial math, engineering math?,;/2
train,;/I'd argue that's not conveying an idea like written language, but rather understanding and recognizing a pattern so as to understand functionality similar to know you would do so when looking at a common circuit.,;/2
train,;/I would agree and I thought about that however I cannot resolve something in my mind: I go out of my way to write code to look more like the pattern for easier readability. To me, that seems language like. It is the same way I would modify a sentence to sound more like a common idiom. It picks up a shade of meaning and understanding.,;/1
train,;/You make a good point. It makes me wonder how other things that do not inherently carry meaning but have meaning superimposed on them are processed in our brains. i.e. how are emoji and other pictograms processed Sort of connected, I wonder how people who read but do not speak a language process writing. I know that people who are deaf often have a harder time processing writing because a lot of written language has a basis in how it is pronounced. I wonder if they process written language closer to how this study shows people process code.,;/1

In any case, I can recommended to everyone that has an inkling of curiosity about compilers to write one. And I can certainly recommend NAND2Tetris.,;/2
train,;/>I won't deny it wasn't challenging, but in the end if you can divide up the work and conquer each part separately everything becomes managable. Right, I think this is what makes it not difficult. A lot of projects turn into a ball of spaghetti (take any large C++ app and try to find the part that does something useful - you can't!) but a compiler has a simple structure. It's just a set of passes that run one after the other. That means it's easy to test and it's easy to learn how a production compiler works by reading the debug output.,;/1

train,;/I remember a friend of mine who is an IT manager took on a project on overhauling some government system that was still relying on Cobol. He told me he had to incentivize retirees to come out of retirement to do the project and was basically at their mercy. He said at one point "I'm afraid of two things. My Cobol programmers walking out or passing away in the middle of the project.".,;/2

train,;/I did it for a few years. Some mainframe work with CICS but mostly for PC apps and even web applications. I wouldn't go back.,;/2
train,;/The reasons these systems never get updated is because they are so complex no-one understands them anymore. Gathering requirements for systems that no group of people currently understand is near impossible, and is the reason so many legacy systems get left in place until they can't be managed. And no manager/bean counter ever wants to do a re-write to something modern, because the costs of doing so is basically the same as writing it from scratch. So we keep our legacy systems near indefinitely and its not going to stop with COBOL. Any older complex system eventually has the details of what it does lost to the ether and the cost of replacing the system becomes the same or more than the original system cost to build.,;/2
train,;/The following is probably the two most important snippets from the article: *"...all experienced technical meltdowns"* AND *"...They might not have an easy time finding the programmers they need."* The problem those state agencies are having with some of their legacy software systems is a computing capacity problem. The mainframe systems went from processing X transactions per day to many times X transactions per day, and they just didn't have that capacity. Unless the plan is to re-write or re-engineer those software systems using COBOL, I do not see how hiring more COBOL programmers would solve the problem those state agencies are currently experiencing.,;/2
train,;/Back in college I had a year of Cobol. The course head literally told us that they put it on the course because they saw jobs opening up from people retiring or dieing.,;/2

train,;/My interest in software has always been because of video games. I grew up reading about these kinds of things.

train,;/That was riveting from start to finish. (I'm not joking.),;/2
train,;/That's why we pay them the big bucks.,;/2
train,;/A lot of old programs would also stuff data into the *top* bit of pointers, which worked as long as operating systems reserved the top 2gb for internal use. This is why Windows programs require a special flag to use that top 2gb.

train,;/Technically one use could be to make or listen in on satellite phones. There has been some significant progress on hacking and reverse engineering Iridium satellite communication.,;/2
train,;/A few things: One of the most important is to secure your own satellites from unauthorized use. This is very important if you are building satellites for the government or private business. Second, to gain unauthorized access to another satellite. This could be for corporate espionage, governmental purposes, or personal gain. Third, would be to regain access to your own satellite after a failure or some issue preventing normally designed access. Ultimately, increasing the general knowledge of how satellites are hacked increases the overall security and expectations of security, so that's a very good thing for the industry. There are countless purposes for hacking satellites with most depending on the application of the said satellite.,;/1

train,;/It's all this gobbledygook to make Javascript behave like a *"real"* language that drives those of us who have been coding for a long time CRAZY. I've been coding since the 80s. My first paying gig was writing pascal. I've done everything from C/C++ to C# to Python (yay) to Perl (yuck) to Assembly (THE POWAH) to Java to Javascript to Pick Whatever The Fuck You Want. Javascript was a hideous toy language that everyone collectively decided to take more serious than it ever deserved and then spent the next 20 years trying to shape into something that doesn't suck.,;/2
train,;/You can still do plain old Javascript, just like you can do plain Java. The people that like to solve made up problems (because writing the same web app & service over and over again gets boring) or see every large team coordination problem as something that should be fixed with another layer of tooling got tired of piling on Java and moved to Javascript. Doesn't mean that folks that just want to get things done need to do what they do. The vast majority of web use cases do not require all of this. Spend your time understanding the dom, ajax, and localstorage, not learning leaky abstractions over top of it.,;/1
train,;/It's not really something to fear.. Learn the basics first then pick a well known library and make a hello world app with it. Rinse and repeat until you feel comfortable with a set of tools that work well for you. Then just pick up what you need for a job you want.

train,;/> The vast majority of web use cases do not require all of this. That's true, because the overwhelming majority of web pages are trivial. But the trend over the past couple of decades is moving away from webpages built by that guy in the marketing department "who knows HTML", to rich applications -- i.e. applications with UIs as sophisticated and powerful as desktop applications -- built by real engineers in teams. They have radically different expectations about platforms and tooling. HTML/CSS/Javascript is a clusterfuck of bad/inconsistent design and historical baggage. > Spend your time understanding the dom, ajax, and localstorage, not learning leaky abstractions over top of it. You appear to use the term "leaky abstractions" as a dismissive pejorative, which is missing the point. Abstraction is fundamental to programming. The fact that abstractions leak is something to recognize and be aware of, not a reason to avoid abstraction. I lead a distributed team of two dozen engineers working on a huge, rich-client medical application for the web, ported from Silverlight. The idea of people checking-in code in a typeless language to our code base in 2016, code whose errors can only be detected when run, coding in a language that's almost incapable of benefiting from modern tooling (code inspection, refactoring tools, static analysis, etc.), is insanity. Favoring raw DOM manipulation over a clearly defined MVVM pattern, is almost equally insane. We're not only using a framework, we've built more framework on top of that framework, which is true of any major application on the desktop as well. The result is that the actual non-framework code we write is clean, clean, clean, ultra succinct, properly decoupled, etc. Our feature velocity -- our ability to rapidly, sustainably add new features without generating technical debt -- is due to pushing all complexity and boilerplate not related to business logic into the framework. Yes, this means the application code is built on a giant pile of abstraction, but the same is true of any modern development stack on the desktop as well (e.g. WFP + .NET + Entity Framework). Our Silverlight code base was much cleaner than most because we did the same thing there, creating abstractions on top of our ORM (which itself an abstraction over the database), post-compile modification of byte code to inject features impossible in the language or framework, etc. These framework layers were complicated and took hundreds of man hours to develop and test, and maybe only save a few minutes for a developer building a new feature. But those minutes add up over dozens of developers over years of use. More importantly, those features were designed to eliminate types of code that tends to be more error prone or require more testing, leaving only business logic as much as possible, which results in a more robust applications, fewer support hours spent, ect. Those kinds of large scale development practices might not matter if you're building a website for your buddy's DJ business, but it can make the difference between ongoing success and eventual implosion when building industrial sized applications. Those kinds of applications just didn't used to be built on the web. The proliferation of frameworks today is the direct result of more larger scale engineering efforts happening on the client.,;/1

It was that if-statement. It’s gone. No longer needed. The code has been refactored so that, regardless of the object’s position in the list, the same process is applied to remove it.",;/3
train,;/Basically it's most likely because the code on the right hand side avoids the extra conditional. One code to do it all. If you can avoid handling special cases because they're not special cases, then you avoid forgetting about updating them if you have to change the code at some time in the future. This has been discussed recently under the subject of "code taste".,;/1
train,;/In the following TED talk: http://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux ... Linus talks about how one implementation of `remove_list_entry(...)` in a linked list is better than the other. I found myself bemused, seeing as I was thought that focusing on readability is better than being clever (unless you really, really need to optimize the thing you're working on). I am sure I'd waste 10x as much of a maintainer's time if I used the right implementation over the left implementation. Or it might be that I don't have experience with coding C, and the right implementation isn't that obscure as I thought. I'm more of a Python/C#/Java guy.,;/1
train,;/I love making special cases not special.,;/2
train,;/Fewer conditionals = better pipelining.,;/2
train,;/> Or it might be that I don't have experience with coding C I think it's really just experience. The right code is conceptually much simpler, not only does it lack an `if`, it is also much closer to how one would solve the problem in natural language: "start at the head, walk the list until the current position contains the entry, replace current position with the next element, thus removing the current". Or try to draw the problem with pen&paper, chances are you won't create a `prev` box to hold a temporary. The issue is that this simplicity is lost when you are not familiar with C and pointer. The references Java or Python give you are somewhat similar to pointers, but this kind of indirect access is exactly what they can't do. You can't get a reference to the reference to `head`, you can only get a copy of the reference to head, thus needing additional book keeping when you want to modify the actual reference to `head` instead of your copy.,;/1
train,;/This is bad relationship advice.,;/1
train,;/The magic that is branch predictors negate most of the benefits that the processor would have (although there would be some small amount by simply not polluting the predictor table). Linus primarily liked the code on the right because fewer branches mean the code is easier for the developer to reason about. There are minimal paths that this code can take to execute, less state in the head of the developer to maintain.,;/1
train,;/It's not just about better pipelining or better performance; code with less conditionals is generally easier to read and understand than code with more conditionals. And in this specific example, the pointer-pointer indirection also removes a bunch of special-cases, which is even better. Conditionals and conditional branching is in my opinion the very definition of business logic. As an experiment in your free time, start a real project you can finish in a weekend or less, then abstract all your conditionals and loops away by separating and tucking them all into short functions. It might make your eyes twitch at first, but when you are done, your code should be incredibly readable. Like a list of sequential steps.,;/2
train,;/> code with less conditionals is generally easier to read and understand than code with more conditionals. That really depends. You can understand what's going on more easily maybe, but you might not understand the intention as well. In the code above I don't find the non-conditional code easier to read even though it is probably better, though I'm not entirely convinced that it generally is outside of a kernel context.,;/1

Typically you have to have a local git guru in your team - who spends his/her time doing practically nothing else but extract colleagues from their git pain - that's not how it should be. Well - Github I like - but couldn't it have been HGHub instead? One thing for sure, Linus Torvalds is chuckling all the way to his basement. Okay - end rant...,;/1
train,;/Hey thanks!,;/2
train,;/Awesome guide,;/2
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/I'm glad that you found it helpful 😊,;/2
train,;/more like forgit haha...,;/2
train,;/Dammit, this is sadly accurate but going to help me prevent it.,;/2
train,;/I feel attacked...,;/2
train,;/Monday's article: \> Stop saying coding is easy Friday's article: \> Stop saying coding is hard Repeat weekly ad fucking infinitum as per every crappy bloggers wet dream.,;/1
train,;/Well, coding at shitty levels IS easy. And let's be honest, most people just want to code a shitty Arduino application or some shitty alarm clock.,;/1
train,;/Coding is easy. Software architecture/design is hard,;/2
train,;/I'll be curious to see how this all pans out in 20 years. The fast-paced boot camps, the "everyone should code" campaigns, the visual programming paradigms, etc. It seems like we're placing a huge amount of emphasis on recruiting and outreach but very little effort on sustainability and long-term career insight. Sure this stuff will attract tons of people, but what's the retention rate going to be like? And what's the code quality going to be like, on average?,;/1
train,;/Writing a sentence is easy. Try writing a novel that people actually want to read.,;/2
train,;/10 PRINT "PROGRAMMING IS EASY" 20 GOTO 10 1. Learning enough to understand "toy" code examples is easy. 2. Learning enough to automate simple, useful tasks is medium hard. 3. Learning enough to make large, maintainable applications is hard. I'd say everybody ought learn code at level 1 above, just to make the concept non-magic. People whose main work involve some kind of non-trivial data processing ought to learn to code at level 2, using whatever tools are relevant for their field (like Excel). Learning to code at level 3 is usually only worth it if programming is going to be your main profession.,;/1
train,;/Coding is medium.,;/2
train,;/The problem is that the basic principles of coding are relatively simple, it's not some mystic process that requires years of study in some basement somewhere. Writing a "hello world" application is dead easy, and turning mathematical formulas into powerful applications is something you can do with next to no experience. However, computer systems are complicated and the way that things interact do require a fair bit of understanding. The more systems you try to tie together, the harder it will be. In part because documentation is spotty at best, and in part because you need to have a solid idea of how all the systems tie together. Programming has a simple foundation that has a lot of complexity built upon it. Tl;dr It's easy to write a program to do your math homework, it's hard to write an application that can do your math homework, show the work, and automatically email it to your English teacher.,;/1
train,;/Stop saying coding is medium,;/2
train,;/Software is the medium.,;/2
train,;/I want to point out that the individual who made this does not work at Google...,;/2
train,;/One thing that might be important to note is the systems design interview. This interview is only given to people coming in as L4s and up (generally 5+ years experience) so it doesn't show up on most Google interview resources. You need to demonstrate the ability to solve a problem via distributed computing and answer questions regarding resource requirements, scalability with respect to hardware, latency, etc.,;/1
train,;/I actually had the hidden Google coding challenge foobar pop up for me while searching programming related info that apparently if you finish all of the topics they ask for your contact info and sometimes contact you for a job. I finished two test without help the third test I needed help. Still haven't finished cause their nerv racking you can start a test anytime and have to finish in two days. Theirs like five test the code has to pass and if it doesn't do it fast enough you'll fail. No logs and no explanation why it failed just these test failed. You get dropped into a terminal session and cat the directions. And write the file as answer.py or in java.,;/2
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/Flip side: When your dream is to improve your coding skills to the point that a company with a well-known high quality bar is willing to accept you, then that doesn't sound so unreasonable? Nothing wrong with using an external metric to measure your progress. (Also, the fact that you've then scored a job with [Fortune's #1 place to work](http://fortune.com/best-companies/) is probably not a bad thing either.),;/0
train,;/But those are the people Google wants. Like Amazon. 80 hour weeks? Come on down!,;/2
train,;/No idea why you were downvoted. This guy doesn't even say why they want to work for Google so bad, it's a given. Even buying future Google stickers. As someone said, this is setting himself up for major disappointment when Google turns out not to be cloud cuckoo land.,;/2
train,;/At least when I was at Google (starting in 2009)...no. The people who usually ended up at Google and did well there were ones who had no ambition at all to "work at Google", and it sorta fell into their lap. My coworkers there included a former punk rock bassist who got sick of touring, a film studies major who happened to pick up programming on the side and discovered it was easier to get a job there, *two* philosophy majors who decided Google was a better option than law school or grad school, and a large number of startup founders (including myself) for whom Google was the consolation prize when their startup didn't take off.,;/1
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/Most had some programming experience before Google, although in many cases it was just hobby projects. Still made for a portfolio they could put in the resume though. I think, for the most part, it was largely "show up to the interview and do a good job on it". The ones with more non-traditional backgrounds (eg. the film studies major) often went to good schools, but not necessarily Ivy-League, and indeed, probably a majority of my colleagues there went to state schools. I think that if you're open to new possibilities but not completely desperate for a job, that comes across in the interview, and it tends to skew the conversation to your benefit. There's also pure dumb luck. Google gets millions of resumes; oftentimes people get to the interview stage just because their resume stood out to some HR temp, or because that temp had a quota to make, and conversely people might get rejected just because they apply late in the year when Google is trying to ramp down spending.,;/1
train,;/That's the thing with Git, it's actually pretty simple to just Add and Commit some files. It's the only thing you do 90% of the time. It's just when you start Merging, and Rebase, Check out, Revert, Reset, Patch, etc, it's far to easy for your repo to explode into a huge unrecoverable mess. I've been using Git for just over 10 years, and I still get nervous when I need to do an advance/normal every day command.,;/2
train,;/True. Once I messed up my local repository and have to reclone everything. 😅,;/2
train,;/I find git quite simple to use with a good GUI like GitExtensions or SourceTree, even for 'advanced' usage like rebasing branches or subtree or else you don't need the console at all.,;/2
train,;/I highly advice you toeread http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html It explains how git works internally, and once you understand that, everything become easy.,;/3
train,;/Almost everything in git is non-destructive. For "undo", see `git reflog` to see what changes you've made and you can checkout the appropriate version with the commit hash.,;/1
train,;/Never used Git GUI.. but seems good idea when messed up.,;/2
train,;/Cool.,;/2
train,;/This is as hilarious as it is mildly depressing. Kudos, OP.,;/2
train,;/This was a very good read, thank you for posting it,;/2
train,;/An interesting article for the technical aspects of inspecting a protocol and automating things but I hope no one actually does this 😓,;/2
train,;/If you are to do this, be sure to remove mitm's cert from the device afterward, or better yet use an old device with nothing else on it.,;/2
train,;/Dating apps will bomb your visibility if you just swipe right on everything. Cute though,;/2
train,;/1. Automate swiping right on their profiles 2. Scrape their social media for their interests and hobbies 3. Train a RNN with a million chat conversations, including their personal details, and throw in a few classic pick-up lines 4. Call Google Assistant to book a restaurant that's close to her 5. Integrate with Apple Calendar to add the dates to your planner 6. Post a task on Mechanical Turk for someone to go on the date and have sex with her on your behalf. Fully automated process.,;/1
train,;/>I hope no one actually does this 😓 Spammers most certainly do,;/2
train,;/Can you explain why ?,;/0
train,;/I don't know if mitm proxy generates its own certs on install now, but having self signed certs for mitm software on your device is not ideal.,;/2
train,;/The pragmatic programmer is a master piece,;/1
train,;/On a related note, I wish more programming books were spiral bound. I like to lay a book flat on my desk while I explore the code examples.,;/2
train,;/I think a very important book that is missing is clean code by Bob Martin,;/1
train,;/Office Depot will re-bind the book to spiral if it's not too thick; I've done it with a bunch of books and it's not expensive.,;/1
train,;/I agree. It gives you sensible *guidelines*. I'm still bewildered by having to explain fellow devs of all experiences and sizes that 14 arguments constructors aren't the way to go.,;/2
train,;/All the other books on the list are heavy on science. Clean Code would be an odd addition - it’s basically just Bob’s unscientific opinions about coding style. I agree, the book is a valuable read, but the other books are just on another level.,;/2
train,;/Exactly. 15 is the sweet spot.,;/2
train,;/>14 arguments constructors The builder pattern get's around those pesky 14 argument constructors ;),;/2
train,;/If anyone wants to read on stuff like this I recommend Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom. Very good concepts there.,;/1
train,;/The builder pattern always seems so elegant but I feel like my coworkers would just say it’s over engineering and to just use an object.,;/2

train,;/I'm guessing: * **XML**: You don't really write your program in it, but you still need to know how to use it. * **SQL** **XQuery**: Projects using it aren't tagged as such because it's embedded in other code. * **Delphi**, **Ada**: Lots of old code to maintain. Not really a fancy new language for open source project. * **D**: Only its maintainers are using it, they do not need to ask any questions (that, or people are using their awesome forum instead). * **ActionScript**: Simple language for simple things. Nothing to ask questions about. * **TeX**, **VimL**: A lot of personal and side project stuff stored on github. * **AutoIt**, **AppleScript**: Commercial and personal use. * **Mathematica**: Students asking questions about homework. * I'm not sure about **Cuda**.

train,;/Java, still killing it,;/1
train,;/There's an Objective-C++?,;/0
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/I think many can be explained by the users they are targetting and their mindsets. For example, a former C/C++ developer looking into D would have learnt to study documentation and research the language & standard library carefully before asking, because if you didn't do that, you would probably have had a hard time even getting started with C/C++, given the many pitfalls. Conversely, I imagine a Visual Basic developer not exactly being a hardcore hacker, but far more casual, doing small projects or jumping into old or others code, and using the quick & easy method for getting help to "fix that Excel macro to arrange the spreadsheet properly into a text file". So I think part this, and part how scarce the documentation might be. Assembly language is hardware dependent, fragmenting the common knowledge you'll gain by studying the language, F# is sort of Microsoft's often forgotten .NET child. AppleScript, AutoIT, SQL used for so specialized scenarios ("do this with my computer", "how to do this with our database") that online info might usually be lacking. Delphi ranks reeeally high above the curve for some reason though, even more than Visual Basic. It surprises me, I expected it to be largely used by a close knit community these days while being old enough to have vast amounts of documentation.,;/2

train,;/What's with the `\\`? `\` is the line continuation symbol and you have code after it, so it's giving you the "unexpected character after line continuation character" error.,;/1
train,;/Isnt the error about the additional "," at the end of printf? Seems like you want to pass another variable to printf and it awaits something but after " ," There is nothing,;/1
train,;/So, there are a couple of things here, let's go step by step. First, the error you encountered is because of an extra `,` at the end of your print statement. Second, in your comment, you mentioned that you want it print *month/day/year*; this print statement will not do that as it can print only strings or variables and `\\` is neither. A quick fix is replacing `\\` with `"\\"` assuming you want backslashes there. Do note that, by default, print will add a space between the strings separated by comma; you can remove that by using the `sep` parameter. The final print statement: `print("The date is:, month, "\\", date, "\\", year, sep="")` Third, better way of doing this would be to use f-strings as suggested by others. I won't explain how they work here but here's how you use them in your case: `print(f"The date is: {month}\\{date}\\{year}")` This will automatically get month, date and year from their variables,;/1
train,;/print("The date is ",month1,"\\\\",day1,"\\\\",year1),;/1
train,;/I need it to print month/day/year. I thought double backslash prints a backlash,;/2
train,;/Not when they're not `str`s. Just use f-strings.,;/1
train,;/im very new to this and i have no idea how to do that would you please explain?,;/0
train,;/U say that likes it’s obvious while OP be on Python Task #1,;/2
train,;/f'{month}/{day}/{year}' The `f` before the quotes tell Python that it's a f-string. The curly braces within the quotes are used to denote variable substitution.,;/1

train,;/Coding in general is a very taxing task, it’s very normal to feel overwhelmed. Coding is like any other skill, you just got to sit down and start practicing, you’ll eventually develop a rhythm on how you tackle problems. Many problems in the computer science field, coding, mathematics, etc require an immense amount of critical thinking and sometimes the solution isn’t obvious and you’ll bang your head days on end trying to get something to work. As someone who minored in computer science whilst majoring in applied mathematics, I felt the exact same way starting out. But don’t worry, keep your head high and push forward, the reward is definitely worth it,;/1
train,;/Millions of very smart people have been advancing computer science for 60+ years. There’s no way you’ll know everything,;/2
train,;/I started last week, I know that if you try to do at least a little coding a day, it won't seem as hard or big. I'm not that good at it, but I'm starting to get into a daily routine, and that really helps the nerves.,;/2
train,;/Honestly when i started coding i was completely overwhelmed and had no idea what i was doing. I was just giving up and coming back all the time. It took me time to process everything and today it all makes sense finally. Focus on the basics as much as you can and if u learn something new learn to master it so it really sticks and you have a good understanding,;/2
train,;/When I started I was packed with so much dang information that I had pretty frequent panic attacks. My best advice is to know that you don't have to keep all this stuff in your head. You'll learn a language, use it, and then find a problem that calls for a different language. You'll keep learning them, and when you have to go back to a past one, you just look up references. The best thing you can do is learn syntaxes, like how python cares about white space but not about semi colons but Javascript is the opposite,;/2
train,;/Alright thanks for the reassurance. I really appreciate it and I’m definitely going to put forth my best effort.,;/1
train,;/Yeah that’s definitely true lol. Thanks.,;/2
train,;/Yeah I do like an hour and a half everyday which helps a lot,;/1
train,;/I always recommend doing a 101 and 102 course at your community college. But lots of people don’t want to do that. Pick a language. Check out newer coding book for that language from a library and get through it, being able to understand the exercises they have you do. Start with one language. Once you understand a language well, and you understand how to think through problems, almost all other languages are similar except with different syntax and easy to pick up. It’s also many many times easier if you have a friend or mentor type person that knows what they’re doing. Probably most your struggles, we’ve all gone through and can explain it in easy concepts,;/1
train,;/Thanks so much man and I’m still in high school but I’m going to take come cs that they have. But I’m definitely going to do that. Appreciate it!,;/1
train,;/The border property can't be specified with pixel width alone. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border `border: 1px solid black;` for example,;/1
train,;/Random first observation is that in your html your body tag opens on line 33. It should open on line 10 instead, directly after your head tag closes.,;/1
train,;/I want a border around the blue float element but it won't work I'm not even sure if my pictures are showing properly on here but if they are any tips are super helpful edit: Finally figured it out! thank you guys for all your help!,;/2
train,;/*```border-width: 1px;``` might be it,;/1
train,;/border: size, type, color E.g: border: 1px solid black;,;/1
train,;/I think what you're looking for is border, instead of margin for the css under . container1 Margins are transparent, and are mostly used to provide empty areas.,;/1
train,;/Border: 1px solid black; You need to specify the type of border, solid, and colour I believe,;/1
train,;/idk php but in your html your href=“mystyle.css” but your css file is named “styles.css” so that won’t work...and if the files are in the same directory you should add a “./“ so the same directory is referenced. so, if you keep the current name of the css file as “styles.css”, your html href should be “./styles.css”,;/1
train,;/I believe you want to put the PHP print commands inside a <div> tag. You can then give the div tag a class or ID of print by doing <div class="print"> I can't remember which uses a hashtag and which uses a period out of the two, I believe class is the hashtag but I could be wrong.,;/1
train,;/So php is a server side language. The string will be printed within the html. However print is a php command and is not rendered, it's executed. Php stands for php hypertext processor (the php part is a recursion joke), html stands for hypertext markup language. So php processes html (for our purposes here). On the server you have your php file, which is being sent to the client as html. Anything that is contained by the <?php ?> Tags will not be sent over to the client, only what it outputs will be. In this case the string you are printing is going to be output. There is no print tag being sent over. You can know this by using inspect element for the rendered page. You'll see there is only the html above and below the php, and the output of your code, which is the printed strings. Later as you do more with php you'll start to see how this is so useful. With that in mind, you would put whatever html you want to use for styling purposes within that string or above and below it. For example: `print "<div>";` `print "whatever you want to output within your div";` `print "</div>";` And then you can add a div class or whatever you want.,;/1
train,;/#print { font-size: 2em; font-style: italic, bold; },;/1
train,;/I think if you styled the php tag, or tried putting it in a div and styling that, php is a sub-language, you can't effect it's elements with css.,;/1
train,;/Add an identifier,;/1
train,;/Stop using notepad ++. Use vscode/sublime/atom even eclipse. Trust me people will say your text editor don't matter but it does.,;/1
train,;/`#` is the id selector, `.` is class :),;/2
train,;/Instead of using `#print`, you need to use do something like `print "<p class=\"php\">text</p>";` then for css `p.php { … }`,;/1

train,;/Repetition - admittedly it’s hard to wrap your head around it at first. But the more you get into it, the easier it’ll be for you to understand the concepts. Should you need any help or have any other questions, feel free.,;/1
train,;/80% of it is understanding how to think, which simply takes time and examples and practice and repetition. Once you have that, picking up new code or reading code is more or less understanding differing syntax that does the same thing. 10% is repetition/practice. Practice makes things easier. Practice gets ideas firmly rooted in your head and makes future things easier. 10% is simply experience. With experience, you will simply be more knowledgeable. You will better be able to read documentation and not get stuck simply because you didn't understand in a dry technical manual that is 1000 pages long. Experience will cause you to understand similar concepts. Experience will cause you to have an understanding of how to approach something. There's not really any shortcuts to these. Everyone you think is super smart or a natural was at your point once, and they either had good tutorials, good teachers, good coworkers etc that helped them get over a new hump,;/1
train,;/Hey, you can do it, I'm also a newbie in coding a d trust me it just easier. Just keep practising every day and keep your motivation up. You may also have to learn some concepts over and over again. I had to learn CSS flexbox and grid thrice to get it. Know yourself, some of us don't grab thing at once, we need repetition. Check freecodecamp.org. they have a simplified curriculum.,;/1
train,;/I personally find that the online courses are convuluted and confusing and often the task you're given makes absolutely no sense when you read it. Personally when I'm learning a language I like to first look up how to do a function which I then will use to make programs like find min, find max, search a list, input validation etc. Those programs help you to get used to using things like arrays, if statements, loops, and plus or statements, mathematical operators and user input and output commands. It also forces you to read through the code and understand it by error checking and using stack overflow for what you can't figure out to find what you need.,;/2
train,;/Really appreciate it. I noticed lots of repetition in the lessons alone, which is dope. It kind of starts off slow with most information given and then slowly takes the info away and makes you input more and more of the code until you are writing small lines.,;/2
train,;/And I am super stoked to dip my toes into these waters and hopefully in the future be a part of all you code wizards. And I don’t have any friends or resources at the moment that could help me learn, I know the internet is full of useful info and I will dig deep until I get somewhat versatile.,;/2
train,;/Awesome, thank you. Yeah I’m a slow visual learner. But I’m having a great time learning it. I’ll check out freecodecamp.,;/1
train,;/A lot of it is giving you the frame work and the knowledge to ask the right questions. If you don’t know those questions you will know where to look and how to find it.,;/2
train,;/I recommend codecademy to everyone that wants to start. It'll be a decent jumping off point. Personally, the SoloLearn apps taught me a lot and are surprisingly good. I've heard good things about FreeCodeBootcamp as well. Everytime you learn something new, do a project. Maybe you have one large idea, so break it into smaller things on what you need to do to make the bigger piece. Then figure out what you need to do and learn for those smaller pieces. Keep breaking it down until you have a decent idea of what you need to learn and do, and then go and learn and do it. Don't feel like you can't google stuff while programming. I've been working with Python for 6 years and do open source stuff with it all the time, but I still catch myself googling basic stuff that slips my mind when I'm thinking at a million miles a minute. Just jump in head first and have fun! You got this!,;/1
train,;/What we be a good way to stay noticed and having fun with it, because it can get very frustrating very fast. And being new, those frustrations are prevailing over the rewards at the moment.,;/2
train,;/When desired effect of the loop is reached, variable “menu” should change to false and that will finish while loop,;/1
train,;/I am curious, 1. why a loop with a switch? and 2. why is menu not set to false at time of break?,;/0
train,;/Your Last case is not supposed to be case. it needs the end of the loop to be as followed default: cout << "Goodbye"; menu = false; break;,;/1
train,;/its not letting me choose any cases and just infinitly runs the menu function, so i cant reach the desired effect,;/2
train,;/So for my cs course for uni we have to create a c++ console app, i decided to make a food nutrition sorta app, and after login/sign up is done the entire app will be the menu but you choose options to from the menu to use the app, the menu, once a user is done with an option, they will want to choose something from the menu again, and they may want to do this an "infinite" number of times so the menu must meet that user requirement and be available an indefinite number of times until the user is done with the app,;/2
train,;/This is not true at all. You dont need a default section unless there are possible values not handled by a case. If you have a 'case' for each situation default will never occur. You also dont need the bottom case (whether specific or default) to break since there is no more cases below.,;/1
train,;/Oh, so I think if statement should be more suitable here, try “if(menu == true){menuFunction();}” Let me know if You got what You wanted *writing on my phone sorry for poor style,;/1
train,;/thx.,;/2
train,;/Yeah thats what i had originally, i guess ill just switch it back, thanks,;/2
train,;/If your menu is infinitely repeating it means you never set 'option' to 7 which is in the part of code you failed to show us. The problem is not with your switch, nor is there a problem with your while loop,;/1
train,;/When you create a socket server you `bind` the socket to a specific address. When you create a socket client you `connect` to an address. In both cases you create a socket using the `socket` function and close it using `close` or `closesocket` (windows only). Im not a native English speaker but I think the question uses poor wording and is talking about the server. In that case it would be the `connect` function which isn't used.,;/1
train,;/I don't know what it's asking but looking at this [link](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/cs50/socketprogramming.html) I would say closesocket() is the answer,;/3
train,;/I believe it's asking on the clients side which function is not used. So the client connecting to the server will only do 3 of the 4 things. EDIT: After a little reading, Close() can be initiated from either end and is definitely used. The client and server have to have the same port for example, the client connecting to the server will type in the servers IP followed by a colon and a port number. For example 256.0.0.1:25565 Whether that's done in socket() or connect () I don't know. I also don't know what bind() does. I hope that helps you a little though.,;/1
train,;/I never see closesocket,;/2
train,;/What app are you using?,;/0
train,;/Depends on the language,;/2
train,;/I did exactly this in my networking class a couple years ago in C using Winsock 2.0. Assuming the question is meaning "client connecting to server" the answer is "bind()." That function is not used in such a connection.,;/1

train,;/I believe it’s adding 1 to Count if I is divisible by 2. If not it adds 1 to I. Once I is greater than or equal to 100 it will print the value of Count and end the program. If I:2 = 0 isn’t a mod function then I’m wrong.,;/1

train,;/function graphIt(){ if (result = "You") { win++; } if (result = "The Computer") {loss++; } if (result = "No One")tie++ location.href = "lab6graph.html"; var win = parseInt(localStorage.getItem("winTotal")) || 0; var loss = parseInt(localStorage.getItem("lossTotal")) || 0; var tie = parseInt(localStorage.getItem("tieTotal")) || 0; } This is what the new code looks like and it does now register a tally for each category but beyond that nothing has changed. No errors to really work off of.,;/1
train,;/Put the `var win = parsetInt(...)` at the top of your function in-place of where you have `var win = 0;` in the screenshot of your post.,;/1
train,;/Also, where you have `if (result = "You")` `if (result = "The Computer")` `if (result = "No One")` You need to use two `==` not just 1 `=` &#x200B; (assuming the variable result is set globally),;/1

train,;/They can detect when nothing on the page has "focus" anymore. Your browser literally fires an event for "window blur" which means that the current window has lost focus. It's kind of primitive, as it can be triggered if Windows pops an alert up in front of your face, your antivirus wants to be renewed, etc. You can mostly work around this by opening the test on a browser running in a virtual machine. You can leave the virtual machine and use the host machine's browser without triggering window blur on the vm ... depending on the vm and how it's configured.,;/1

train,;/Good explanation,;/2
train,;/This is how some video streaming services stop loading when you’re not on the tab. It’s all to monetize on the ads they show,;/2
train,;/I made a mistake in the beginning and thought programming was all about the tools you can use or the programming languages you know. However it really comes down to your soft skills like problem solving, people skills, perseverance, and ability to learn. I would 100% recommend staying with Java since it seems to be the language the that supports your interests the most (minecraft mods). I know it seems tempting to learn another language, but you really don’t need to at the moment. There is a monumental amount of stuff Java can do that I’m sure you haven’t done already. C++ tops that by only 1% extra ability (low level memory access, e.c.t) and maybe faster compile time / execution. C# is basically the same thing as Java except with a few little twists and turns. And C is the same as C++ but just more stuff to think about. I’m not dissing any of these languages at all, you will still progress profoundly if you learn any of these. I’m just trying to recommend the most fun and enjoyable language / path you might want to go down. Don’t think you need to learn C++ because it’s perceived to be powerful or whatever, the difference of execution and compile time is unneeded in your case. Remember: It’s not about the language, it’s about the programmer. P.S: I’m experienced in Java and have dabbled in minecraft plugin development. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.,;/1
train,;/First off, don't learn multiple languages at once. You'll grip the fundamentals much faster if you're just focusing on one language. If you ignore my advice I use visual studio code with the c/cpp extensions, if I code in vim I just use GCC not sure if another one exists.,;/1
train,;/Answer Q#1: Use Visual Studio with extensions Answer Q#2: You should have general idea about programming languages. Read this [article](https://www.computerscience.org/resources/computer-programming-languages/). After knowing languages are for what, I think you should start with [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm) to learn languages.,;/1
train,;/I suggest use Visual Studio Code. It's a text editor with extensions capable of making it like an IDE. Just use different compilers for whatever language you are using. After Java, learn C++, Python, Go. The thing is that once you're familiar with all programming stuff( Object Orientated Programming, polymorphism etc...) you'll be able to get things done in any language as far as you know the syntax. Yes, there are some language specifics with all languages that'll be different, but the borderline idea is the same. You could try to learn the basic concepts of Java( what a class is, what an object is, etc...), learn how to implement them. After that, practice on online coding platforms like Hackerrank, TopCoder, Codeforces, etc... Don't get upset if you can't figure out how to do something ( Most software engineers have a problem figuring things out, you're still a 14 year old). Solving problems on such online sites would require you to convert your thoughts into code. After gaining fair bit of confidence, try to do some projects. Maybe even make some Minecraft mods.,;/1
train,;/Personally I hate eclipse with every atom of my existence it should not exist, bluej is good for learning Java,;/2
train,;/Code blocks has been the easiest to pick up and use for me. And I’m mostly in the same boat. Aside from some programming courses in college and some other assorted pieces of knowledge, I’m as new to this as you. There’s a C++ tutorial on YouTube from freecodecamp by this guy from Giraffe academy. It is a pretty decent intro to the language and covers how to set up the IDE at the beginning.,;/2
train,;/I would recommend learning C first. Honestly if you’re looking to learn C it might really help to learn to manually compile your code with GCC before using an ide. If you are running windows I would suggest installing the Linux subsystem for windows, familiarize yourself with basic terminal commands and usage, learn how to compile a hello world program from the terminal with GCC, and then start learning C from the ground up. Start with variables, expressions, functions, etc. then learn how memory is managed on the computer as understanding the basic physical properties of the computer is almost essential in C. Then I would start learning more in depth about arrays, pointers, structs, etc. C can be a sharp learning curve for a beginner, but if you’re motivated to learn you can definitely do it. If you want any more help I’d be happy to help. I’m a TA at my university and I actually help teach the intro to C course, so I could definitely help show you how to get started. Feel free to DM me for more info,;/1
train,;/Thanks for the advice :) I'll try what you suggested :) Thank you :),;/2
train,;/Thanks for this. I'm just gonna install them and when I'm done with JAVA I'll go to C# next. Thanks again :),;/2

train,;/thanks,;/2

train,;/CSS is your styles, the text in the middle panel. HTML is the panel on the left, the structure of the page. Simply put, HTML is what goes on the page, CSS is what the page looks like.,;/1
train,;/Ok thanks,;/2
train,;/And the two together make headaches!... sorry, I mean Magic!,;/2
train,;/Everything,;/1
train,;/I would say - Take some time, think and write down a few real world problems you face in your daily life. Start with very simple things - like a reminder application or a simple Todo list application. Note down your requirements. Try to identify the programming tasks you have to build the application. Are you creating a console application? Or the one with a UI? How do you take your inputs? How do you receive your outputs? What would be the best way to implement it? Can you use any open-source libraries? Identify the data structures which you need to implement and think of the logic. Try to code it yourself. Understanding theory is very different from applying it to practice. You may get blocked even from the start. Google your issues, search in stack overflow, post a query in Reddit/Quora if you're still blocked, refer your notes and find out answers to all your questions. Once you get your simple application done, you will have learned a bunch of knowledge. Happy coding!,;/1
train,;/It really depends on your line of work and what you want to do with c++. These days with things like QT, there's not much you can't do with c++ if you want to. Even its area of expertise is vast that it truly boils down to what you would like to do with it yourself. For practice, you can look into ACM websites like codeforces or uva onlinejudge.,;/1
train,;/The first thing i did was an encrypting program and a program that stores names in files + other information and you can like view it and edit it.,;/1
train,;/You can get some inspirations from here https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x Just search for c++.,;/3
train,;/Using C++ for video game programming is pretty common. (Iirc, Unity can be either C++ or C#? They're fairly similar.),;/1
train,;/Even making an AI,;/1
train,;/Yes, it'll be harder than doing so in Pyhton (which specialized in that field), but; yes, you can make AIs in C++. As the comment said, with C++ you can do pretty much everything - of course, limitations in skill exist, and the language doesn't specialize in anything, so certain things will be easier in other languages.,;/2
train,;/Ok thanks, do you have any tutorials on coding an ai in c++,;/0
train,;/Sadly none readily available, YouTube and Google are great resources for finding such things though!,;/2
train,;/[https://www.learncpp.com/](https://www.learncpp.com/) This is a good intro to C++.,;/3
train,;/An arduino and C++ would probably be a good start if you’re into robotics. There’s lots of cool tutorials and projects online, and can even get started free with the Arduino IDE,;/1
train,;/Be aware that C++ is tough for a beginner, especially your age. (I also started around that age with C++ as my first language.) To really grasp several concepts, I would first try some easier language that isn't so low level. - Usually I recommend Python so you can practice thinking like a programmer on a higher level. The games Human Resource Machine or 7 Billion Humans are also good for absolute beginners. After you got the basics down and wrote some programs, you can start looking into something more low level like C or C++. (Might take some months or years.) Those languages have harder to thoroughly understand language features and notoriously bad compiler messages which make them very frustrating for beginners. If you want to go into robotics you should also take a look at Arduino or Raspberry Pi after a couple of months of doing C/C++ and some input and actuator units for those. Maybe even PLC programming. (You should rather focus on microprocessors for the first few years though.),;/2
train,;/I see many people advising you to learn Python as opposed to C++. While Python is really easy, learning C++ is definitely better for your use case. After you have a fair grasp of C++, you'll ace other languages. I encourage you to learn C++. It's not an easy task, but you'll get through it. There's a ton of material out there for C++. I suggest you start from this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y. After this, solve some problems in C++ over here https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp. After this, I believe you'll be able to understand many things about programming. Time to learn mathematics. Start by this, https://www.3blue1brown.com/. Learn linear algebra, vector calculus, differential equations. If you really want to go in the robotics field, this is extremely important. After you've done all of this, start learning about self driving cars from here. https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-self-driving-cars--nd113. Don't feel intimidated by this. I was 20 when I learnt all this stuff. You're 13. Do this at your pace. All of this is basically the software side of robotics. You still have to learn about the hardware side. Khan academy has an electrical engineering course. That would be a good starting point. I know I'm crazy that I'm suggesting a 13 year old to do things that engineering students do. But it is what it is. You'll eventually have to do this. So why not start now!,;/1
train,;/Thank you!!,;/2
train,;/Ok thank you I will try out arduino IDE,;/2
train,;/Thank you so much for the advise I will try to start with python!,;/2
train,;/Okay will do, thank you!!,;/2
train,;/I second this. C++ is really tough for a beginner. I learned Java when I was around your age and then Python and I’m happy with where it took me but others here will definitely disagree about learning java first,;/1
train,;/I agree with /u/narcissistPenguin. While C++ is not easy, it is better fit for purpose. If you already know that you want a career in robotic engineering, C++ will give you a head start.,;/2
train,;/lol, I'm always trying to install all of these things into new devs just from experience, but not seen them listed together like this. Clue for number 1: if the desk is devoid of paper, there likely hasn't been any planning.,;/1
train,;/feels like #8 contradicts some of the others? &#x200B; Honestly my biggest problem jumping from simple programs to larger more complex ones was that i sat down to plan them out and couldnt decide what worked best.

train,;/this is great advice! edit* a typo,;/2
train,;/Refactoring is a thing. Depending on your development approach, sometimes the first thing you do is get the code to function and refactor when the time comes. Everyone should strive to find the simplest solution, but sometimes that doesn't come on the first iteration.,;/2
train,;/yes ... i agree,;/2
train,;/I don’t think that learning python first is a good idea. What is the purpose of learning it if you want to create your own games? C++ is a powerful and a great choice for this career path. Start learning C++ and coding concepts and then you won’t waste your time learning some low-level stuff after Python.,;/1
train,;/As far as coding games go, c++ is great for making efficient and fast games. However, it is definitely not as easy as using a game engine like Unreal or Unity. Most game companies use a game engine to make games because there are more pre-made tools to make it easier. Learning a programming language is still recommended for scripting (coding behaviors for objects in games), as c++ is used for Unreal engine and c# is used for Unity. In short, I recommend you to look up Unreal Engine and Unity to determine whether you would rather code your games from scratch or use an engine.,;/1
train,;/The better language is the one you feel better using. Personally I'll take C++ over python any day and over C# too. But thats because it mechanically fits how I imagine program flow better. I've used Python in game modding enough to know I actively dislike it. You should also make your decision based on experience in both languages. The best thing would be to first make a 'hello world' in each. Then something like tic tac toe and an Asteroids or Space Invaders clone with each. There are plenty of tutorials on youtube for each of those in nearly every coding language. That would give you enough experience to decide which is more enjoyable to work with **for you**.,;/1
train,;/Unless you want to get a job in the industry I think you should learn C# and look into a game engine for example Unity. C++ costs a lot more than it tastes. I would recommend Complete C# Unity Game Developer by GameDev.tv on Udemy. They have one for 2D and one for 3D and they cover all the basics in both C# and Unity.,;/1
train,;/> once Python is not enough for me Realistically, this will never really happen. You're probably not going to develop a AAA-like game that will need to squeeze every bit of performance it can. You can use any language you want to make games, like Java, C#, JavaScript, or Python, and it'll probably be enough.,;/1
train,;/Thanks I already thought so :),;/2
train,;/C++ is kinda a weird language and it requires more knowledge about the computer than i think a beginner would have. I'd suggest C# and Unity probably to learn first,;/2

train,;/Checkout https://scrapy.org its a Python web scraper that you can probably easily mod to do exactly what you want and is open source.,;/1
train,;/For a complex site like google maps you will likely need to use a web driver such as “selenium”. Using something like beautiful soup or scrapy probably only get you the initial html and not the information that is dynamically loaded after the html is delivered. Using selenium, you can navigate the web page as if you where clicking around on it and waiting for things to load before clicking on more things. It is a tool commonly used for scraping and automated testing of websites. If you have money to spend I know that google has a good api you can use and it would probably cost you about 20$.,;/1

train,;/In addition to the things listed by others, you have to consider your source. Much of the most active people in online dev communities are in front-end centered space, and OOP isn't something that they use much. It's easy to see something as defunct when you don't use it everyday. There is a whole other group of developers (I'd argue they are possibly the largest group) that shows up to work from 8-5, does their work and goes home without focusing on the online dev communities. Many/most of those people are working in large companies with things like Java. These things also aren't greatly exciting so there isn't as much media about it. New languages and framework get a lot of excitement and that means that you see more about them. Just last year everyone went crazy about DENO being the new NODE replacement, and now I haven't seen it mentioned since then.,;/2
train,;/Pure OOP can be unnecessarily convoluted. There are plenty of examples where the “pure OOP” solution is much much much more complicated than it can be. Somewhat ironically, I think a lot of homework and examples taught in school are much much easier with Functional programming. Imo OOP will still be really dominant for a long time. It makes a lot of sense for business logic and coding.,;/1
train,;/OOP gets accused of being pro-mutation. Mutation is definitely bad if you want concurrent code, but I think you could argue if it's necessary for the spirit of OOP. OOP is also associated with nominal typing, which means incompatibility-by-default in some situations where we don't want that. Finally OOP is associated with the use of inheritance. Inheritance creates inflexibility when the language doesn't support multiple inheritance. Even when you have multiple inheritance, it violates the Liskov Substitution principle.,;/1
train,;/I expect you will get a fair amount of opinionated answers here, so I don't want to go into details about OOP vs other paradigms. Instead I recommend you watch [this presentation](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/) by Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, which gives you an overview of the problems that made people fall out of love with OOP.,;/3
train,;/OOP isn't losing its charm, and it's not going anywhere. It's still very much the present and the future. All the most most popular higher level languages are either purely OOP (Java, C#, etc), or support and utilize OOP as its primary paradigm (C++, PHP etc.). I'm not sure what you're reading, but likely it's just pointing out OOP's shortcomings. All paradigms have shortcomings and this is just noisy chatter. The fact is, the most popular thing in any context always has critics. If in some alternate reality functional programming was dominant, then people would be talking about that more often. In fact, though functional programming isn't as widely used, it's still criticized. That's just the curl of the burl.,;/1

I work with some fairly large code bases (even just the Synfony suite is large) and I think it's very well built and organized. If you want to see spaghetti code, take a look at an average website's JS, which is a functional language. Or look at old web scripting before PHP took an OO turn. I stand by my original points. OOP isn't going anywhere and it's not perfect so there are things to complain about.,;/2
train,;/TLDR I can only help upto connecting the remarkable to the computer First check if you have git installed. Type `git --version` and see it shows the version of git. If you don't have git you have to install it. Type `sudo apt install git-all`, you may have to type your password if prompted. Now repeat step 1 to see if it's installed. Now clone the repo, `git clone http://github.com/evidlo/remarkable_news && cd remarkable_news` Next you will need to ssh into your remarkable. I don't have a one so did some research. First make sure it's connected to your wifi. Then you will need to find its IP address. Here is what the website says, > In order to find the IP addresses, select the "Copyrights and licenses" tab. The IP addresses are found in the bottom right corner." On your computer type `ssh root@ip`. It will prompt you for your remarkable password. After that what every you type in will be sent to the remarkable. From here I am not sure. Check if their are any videos or tutorials of people loading things into their device. That's as far as I can help.,;/1
train,;/that's really helpful! thank you!!!! once I have the remarkable connected so that everything I type goes there, do I need to re-enter the code that I was given so that it goes to the remarkable?,;/2
train,;/As I said previously, I am not sure from this part. Your guess is as good as mine. I recommend to do some research and find how other people installed things on the remarkable.,;/2
train,;/I would guess git clone http://github.com/evidlo/remarkable_news && cd remarkable_news make download_prebuilt make install_nyt Are the actual commands once you are on the device,;/1
train,;/Too much stuff? Really? Like not just some small exercises from your courses or something like that, but actual projects? A lot of CS students don't even bother having their own projects at all. (You can still include these kinds of exercises, much like you can link to your hackerrank or codewars account, but I would just select the significant stuff in this case and bundle all of that to one package.) Generally, even though I am neither American nor working in HR, I would guess that especially code examples that show decent coding style, documentation and knowledge about the respective language and in how to properly version your stuff should be a decent portfolio. Also some clever hacky snippets here and there maybe as long as you demonstrate with other examples that you can also write clean code. (Probably a good idea to categorize them and mention this in a short description, like a table of contents you give them together with your code.),;/2
train,;/Pick the most significant or most challenging projects if you're unsure. I'd say tailor your portfolio to the job you're applying for as much as possible (ex. web dev job = lots of web projects). Always keep the projects that taught you the most in your portfolio, they're great talking points even if not directly related because they can show how you problem solve and learn.,;/1
train,;/Thanks for this !,;/2
train,;/You summed up my career choice. I'm currently a programmer, but not in any game development. I used to enjoy programming in general because of the following: I treated the program itself like a game (where you clear the game if you get the code to work as expected) Now its a given that no code will work on your first try if it is fairly complex. So it becomes like a race towards perfection. How quickly can I solve this issue and get closer to the endgame? Sadly, in truth, you gotta write code with all such pitfalls in mind and its less of a fun game for me now. Lately, it feels more like a world-building exercise where you build your own little world of code that can interact with the rest of the world's code. Hope that helps!,;/2
train,;/How can you know that the aspect you would be more interested in is game development if you have never worked in game development? Reality is that the domain/product you write is something you will care little when this will be your job. Game development is a broad field that encompasses a very large area of development skillsets. You think you're gonna enjoy tracking overflows in your codebase? Writing code in hellish languages like C++? Or writing finite state machines for player movement or AI? Or writing test tooling for your colleagues? Or audio decompression on the fly? Or udp communication protocols? Or debugging virtual machines? Or fighting 10+ years old legacy libraries without docs on a Playstation platform? Because, surprise, surprise, nothing of this sort of programming is specific to game development, games really are a sum of a huge and broad field of technologies of which basically none but probably rendering is specific to game development and even then it's a mixture between complex math and implementation details which will be hardly exciting. Moreover, in all of this, it's not like you're going to have a say in how games will work, or look like, this will be not in your hands. Seriously, whatever dev job you'd find in game development will be on a highly specific task to the point that the fact that a game is the end product will be almost unrelevant compared to: salary, working conditions, colleagues and many other factors. And working conditions in the game development industry are generally pure hell. Lower salaries than people maintaining wordpress websites, while working under huge pressures by both company and public.,;/0
train,;/You do not need to love your job, but you do need to not be miserable because of it. Unless you own your own business, you will be doing work that accomplishes someone else's goals. It's better to change your perspective from, "I need to do something that I love," to, "I need to feel fulfilled by feeling useful by understanding and growing my talents and using them to provide value in exchange for money." In my opinion, having a fulfilling job does not necessitate that you must love it. And I'd rather have a fulfilling job than a job that I simply love. I feel the best about myself in terms of my job when I realize that I'm a little bit better than expected at something in particular and then putting in the effort to realize that potential and surpass even my own expectations of what I can do and accomplish. Growing as a person in a multifaceted way is more important to me than loving my job. Leave your passions as hobbies. Sure, it can be wonderful if it works out that you do what you love and make money from it, but that is the exception to the rule. Take this all with a grain of salt because you haven't had a real job yet, so you have no idea what you will feel and think until you do. Your question isn't a programming one, it's a question about how you choose to live your life and you can only really know that by living it. Only you will know once you experience it.,;/2
train,;/I’m in the same boat. Senior in high school and fascinated by programming but it’s not something I can sit down and enjoy doing at all. It’s hard and mentally draining so it’s hard to do after class and hours of homework because it just feels like more studying. I really just think you’ll need to find an obsessive goal to put up with learning something like programming because it’s hard to learn all the aspects if it’s not applied regularly. Again, in the same boat, so I’m sure this is nothing new.,;/2

train,;/Motivation sometimes follows action: if you just sit down to do it (even when you don’t feel like it), you’ll find yourself almost magically wanting to do it. Set an easy to accomplish goal. Don’t tell yourself: I’m going to code all night. Tell yourself: I’m going to watch the next tutorial video in the series and see where that takes me. This is a good place to start. **Edit: thanks for additional outstanding advice and the gold u/ImPeachMint!,;/1

train,;/I want to add to this: Look for things that annoy you or that you think can be better. - Have a repetitive task? Figure out how to streamline and automate it - Regularly forget your custom bash functions (I have a terrible memory)? Make a function that uses user-centric design to hard bake in a guaranteed way to pull your functions back up (mine is "myfunctions". I had even forgotten that I made that and one day I was sitting in front of bash and said "damn, I wish I wrote a function for this! Wait, I wonder if I did." And to my happy surprise, I had, and it pumped my custom functions out) - start digging with curiosity. Make up a project. Never learned python? Take a tutorial or work through a free course OR, my favorite, find someone else's code and rewrite it while thinking about what everything does. Debug it with break points or try to optimize it or write it in a different way - inspect a website or view it's source and try to understand how and why it works. Try to rebuild it yourself. Wget can be useful to make a mirror copy to work with (use with respect please). I once recreated PUMA's website because I wanted to understand their menus. - PLAY -- super important. This is how humans learn. We don't read a manual for our smart phone, we pick it up and play with it. I've been a coding hobbyist since the early 90s with my parent's HP 85 and early Windows and Mac PCs. Then I decided that remembering formulas for math class wasn't worth the mental space (I'm terrible at memorizing) and so I coded them such that they could take input in different ways and have menus (like Pythagorean theorem taking two legs or leg and hypotenuse, etc) &nbsp; **Edit:** a follow up To be completely candid: as a teen, I taught myself bash scripting because I noticed the repetitive nature of downloading porn pics and videos. It, amusingly, annoyed me. There MUST be a more efficient way. I figure out that wget was a perfect solution for this (I hear curl is good too, but I focused on the former). That script grew and evolved over years to become a magnificent web scraper that does so much more beyond downloading dirty pics. Nowadays I can use it to grab all sorts of docs, images, or whatever off websites and organize and relabel them just by running the script. This is similar to how I taught myself how to use graphic design software. A horny teen who wanted to touch up dirty pics. Now I use that software to make my company's logos and branding. I also taught myself about working with Apple system files when I had to fix my 2010 MacBook Pro crashing due to GPU issues inherent in that model. The crash would routinely ratfuck saved application state files and I would lose everything I had worked on. This is how I created a menu'ed script that created my own, more robust saved application state files and it can pull them back up too. It's OK however you start. It's just important that you do, because if you let the journey, the curiosity carry you along you will be surprised at where it takes you. A little every day over a long period of time adds up.,;/1

train,;/Have any suggestions for coding podcasts? Javascript specifically,;/0
train,;/I wrote it's code in Python(from scratch). It doesn't use any libraries except matplotlib to display noise. I am not sure if what I have done was the correct implementation, but it worked anyways. So can that be considered as perlin noise? If not why?,;/1
train,;/So you can code noise now ?? Wow. (I am not a coder btw, only follow this sub cuz I go to a school for software engineering and what not),;/0
train,;/It’s noise so yes you can consider it at Perlin noise ( I can send you mine wrote in C if you want I got the interpolation too with comment I think ),;/1
train,;/Its noise. Would have to painstakingly read through your code to see if its the EXACT formula perlin uses. If you got something subtly wrong it might still be 'good enough' or it might cause a problem. SO Now that you got some good experience implementing it yourself, throw it away and use an already written library for perlin noise so you can be sure of the quality,;/1
train,;/Perlin's algorithm is documented on how it was achieved. Noise != Perlin. Therefore just because you've created noise, it doesn't mean it is the same algorithm. So it's not safe to call your noise Perlin. While Perlin's algorithm is well known to create textures that we can find in nature, coding isn't about having a single answer to any situation. Perlin noise is costly to compute and often not recommended in real-time generation scenarios such as in a video game environment. There are also various alternatives to Perlin noise such as Fractal, Cubic, or Wavelet noise. It's possible your code is more similar to any of these others. If you're interested in noise, check out this older tutorial (written in C# for Unity) It gets into detail about octaves and frequency and some of the issues Perlin noise has and at least one alternative. https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/pseudorandom-noise/,;/1
train,;/Basically is not “noise” is just the name give to this algorithm I coherent unknown values created with a permutation table ( it’s with this you can have water effect or cloud in video game or animation movies !! ) the very first implementation you can see it’s from the first Tron movie,;/2
train,;/Whats wrong with me coding noise :D?,;/0
train,;/Well, I actually couldn't figure out how interpolation of Perlin Noise works so I calculated average pixel value for each gradient and interpolated it after upscaling 😳,;/2

train,;/Been asking myself the same question, As im 100% stressing on the getting better in one language, Id say my goal is to solve a problem without googling/looking at notes. By problem, I mean a irl application of something. Let's say i want to filter a list of lists and flat map it to a specific type, I'd wanna be fluent enough to do that from memory rather than looking at notes/googling.,;/2
train,;/If you were to get hired for a company tomorrow, could you pull down their repo and read/understand a program written in that language? (or if i gave you an opensource python repo, could you read it and explain it to me?),;/1
train,;/When you feel comfortable knowing syntax and workings of a language. The part after that is knowing the ecosystems of libraries and tools that are apart of the language and that you’re more concerned about how to pull other libraries in and use them.,;/1
train,;/That's a good point. I mean I've made 20 or so simple apps in Flutter (dart) and worked out through so so many hrs of googling and figuring problems out. So I guess maybe I could claim I know dart... but that's a really good way to say it,;/2
train,;/That's so true,;/2
train,;/Be careful with that mentality. I’ve seen amazing, smart, and fast developers still have to pause and google something real quick to remember. With your mentality I’d shape it so it’s more, if you have to google it, you aren’t teaching yourself while you’re googling. You’re looking up a quick syntax reminder and then good to go. I’m just trying to say don’t just measure yourself based on what you can pull out of your ass/memory.,;/2
train,;/That's a good way to understand it. Thanks,;/2
train,;/Agreed. It's much more important to understand how to solve the problem than the specifics. I think "knowing" a language is less about syntax and more about understanding how it does things and why. For example, take Javascript. The first step is obviously learning the syntax and some built-in methods but that's not "knowing" javascript. "Knowing" javascript to me would be being able to explain that while JS does have "classes" they're not really classes, they're objects linked to other objects via a prototype chain. And how that affects your solution,;/1

One tip that always helps me with a project is to read the most complicated parts of the task, then I feel confident to start doing the basic structures I need to implement. if u dm me im happy to help :),;/1
train,;/Break it down. It's very helpful for me if I just start. You usually begin doing the same things no matter what language or framework you're using, doing almost any project has the same first steps - be it organizing your classes, or filestructure, or defining simple getters and setters for objects. That's the beauty of OOP, everything is building blocks that you stack a bit like Lego bricks. It's usually good to have some concept of the finished product in the back of your mind, but just enough to avoid tunnel vision. The idea lends itself to breaking everything down into smaller tasks. When you get stuck, look away. Take a walk or watch an episode of something. Whatever. Just give yourself a chance to put it on a backbones before you make it worse by getting too stressed about it. If you're doing procedural work... well. My sympathies.,;/1
train,;/Start with stuff you do know how to do,;/1
train,;/I find breaking it down helps. Usually I'll open a paint.net project and write down what functions I'll need then break those down into what they need to do. From there you can write some pseudo code for how you want it to work before then writing that as actual code.,;/1

train,;/Maybe try [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/rXuHGLzSmSE), it'll probably help you! :),;/3
train,;/The way I would do it: 1. Setup a `light` and `dark` mode css selector that contains css variables for your colour schemes. For example you'd probably have a `--primary-text-color`, `--primary-bg-color`, and so on in each of your light/dark css. 2. Ensure all your css uses the defined variables instead of hard-coded values for colours 3. Add a button that toggles the light/dark class on your `body` tag, and have everything below that use the variables.,;/1
train,;/You don't simply reverse everything, because of how shadows work with real objects. This is a great write up about how to think about building a dark theme: https://blog.superhuman.com/how-to-design-delightful-dark-themes-7b3da644ff1f Also, I've found this to be really useful to color palettes: https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html,;/3
train,;/If you have a super simple site you could do it like I did here: https://codepen.io/avidworks/pen/WNxNYKV It essentially just toggles a class that changes the background and text colors. You could get fancier and write the script to include local storage, etc.,;/1
train,;/Another redditor actually released their own CSS library called halfmoon that has a built in dark mode feature. I've never actually used it but it might be worth checking out. Edit: Here is the link https://www.gethalfmoon.com/docs/introduction/,;/2
train,;/I hadn't thought about this. I was thinking about changing css variables with javascript. Changing classes would be much easier I think.,;/2
train,;/That would be a no code way to do itbut I don't believe that's what OP is asking for. He/she wants to make a darkmode toggle or button for his / her site specifically. That would mean that he/she would need to actually do some coding instead of relying on a 3rd party extension. I would tend to agree that you could use an event handler to say onclick darkmodeOn() where it toggles all the default classes off and the darkmode classes on. Then just do the reverse for darkmodeOff() I personally use dark reader for everything.,;/1
train,;/I wasn’t suggesting to use a chrome extension, but rather he look at the open source code for how these people did it. The creators of this dark reader have made their code public.,;/1

train,;/Yes the relative path is exactly like shiba mentioned href="../index.html" , and also for cat img you should use an img tag like <img src="../Cat.jpg" alt="" /> happy coding :),;/1
train,;/[https://www.w3schools.com/html/html\_links.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp) Focus on the part "Absolute URs vs. Relative URLs" If you want to go with absolute links... Let's say your website address is `https://www.ga_site.com` Then the path to index.html is `https://www.ga_site.com/index.html` (Depending on your web server, it might default to index.html so you could maybe omit that part, but it's better to be explicit.) The absolute path to the other page would then be `https://www.ga_site.com/dir1/index_2.html` For relative links, you build from where you're at. Since index.html is one directory above, you use the "../" prefix to indicate to go up to the parent directory. If you need to go up 2 directories, then "../../". The good think about relative is that you can develop on your home server, copy to a live server, and everything builds off from its new path.,;/1
train,;/Idk,;/1
train,;/Wow such incredible answer thank you!,;/2
train,;/I went with Java for a bit but now I'm on c++. Caleb curry has an amazing c++ course on YouTube,;/2
train,;/Well the way i did it was, i started off with Javascript, HTML, CSS. Then learned NodeJs, ReactJs, and other frameworks. Then i built a few full stack projects to understand stuff like client-server architecture and database design/management. Then i moved onto Python and C#. Imo once you learn one language and the go through the process of developing a full app you realise that as long as you know how to read api references, documentation and where/how to scour the internet for information you can quickly grasp any language or framework. Always learn through building things, you will never master a language through tutorials or theoretical crap. We are engineers and engineers design, build, break, and build again.,;/1
train,;/What do you mean by “learnt next”? There should be no next, yet. You could spend 5 years learning only JavaScript and still not know it all. JS is such a hugely diverse language you could forge an amazing career out of just that, so don’t jump ship quite yet, spend some time with the language, get to a good level with it. Get comfortable with it. And only then consider a new language. Having an extremely strong base in one language will speed up your ability to learn other languages.,;/1
train,;/what do you wanna do with coding? what do you plan on making?,;/0
train,;/Many people have already answered good answers, but I'll give my take as well. Web programming although is important (and accessible), what you've described here is not actual web programming, as HTML and CSS aren't programming languages - they are markup languages for putting text in a different form. Try learning JS (javascript), as it is an actual programming language created for dynamic web pages. You can code games and actual mechanisms with it. I've had a small experience with it and had some fun. Also, read about frameworks like nodejs and react. (Please don't ask me about it as I have no idea, I coded something very small in nodejs and that sums up my experience.) Note: Java and JavaScript are completely different. Java is a high level programming language for programs and applications, while JavaScript is a language that is highly associated with dynamic websites. Don't mix the two up Personally I don't really like high level. I like C and python (which contradicts my previous statement, but it is for scripting, I am absolutely against writing actual big projects in python). I would advise you actually against learning python for a first language, because it is made a scripting language and has many weird properties. I learnt C# and it is fairly good (or learn Java it may be even better for its popularity and cross platform - although for some reason I dislike it more, maybe because I learnt it in my first Uni course and it left me scarred haha). OOP (object oriented programming) is cool but sometimes (or even most times) is unnecessary and overused, although when used correctly and efficiently - is good. Try to google some positive and negative opinions about OOP to understand it better. If you do show interest in low level I suggest learning C and assembler - albeit you would need some understanding about the inner workings of the computer, mainly RAM and CPU.I believe all should have at least a taste of low level as it is fairly underappreciated, so do yourself a favor and learn a bit of that. Visual studio code and visual studio itself are fairly nice, although Brackets seem fine and if it suits you - go for it. As for tutorials, thenewboston on youtube has some videos, I suggest starting there. Edit: added a part about OOP Edit2: emphasized difference between java and javascript,;/1
train,;/Java is not a popular web language. It definitely has its place in enterprise software, and there's money to be made, but it's a fraction of the webdev market. That said, it and C# are excellent languages to learn because they are 100% OOP and you are forced to learn some good practices. Python is great for data science, and there is a web framework, but it's not very popular despite a lot of people on Reddit talking about it (and the fact that Reddit is built on it). That said, Py will grow most likely, because it is quickly becoming the default first language people learn, and so will be familiar to people. But it's not there yet, we're talking a decade out probably. JavaScript is necessary for web development. Anything slightly complex uses JS, and you will eventually have to use it. That said, I don't recommend starting with it. It will not teach you standard object-oriented programming, which is the standard for the biggest languages on the web. Moreover, JS is really easy to write sloppy, and you will see lots of sloppy JS while you're learning. I say start with the server side and learn JS as you go along and as you need it. Server side means PHP. The biggest language on the web is PHP. Old PHP was not well designed, but PHP after PHP7 has become a great OOP language. If you learn this the *right* way, it will likely open the most doors for you. The right way means that you don't just learn a language, you learn how to program. Two areas of consideration, once you understand the basics of programming and CS, are data structures & algorithms, and object-oriented design patterns. You can google for courses on those subjects. Other random thoughts: 1. Don't ignore the tools. It's not just about programming, it's about the ecosystem. As a webdev you'll have a boost up if you can navigate git, gulp, webpack, docker, and composer. Also, don't use sublime text, brackets, etc. Use Phpstorm. It is easily the best and most powerful IDE for PHP. Jetbrains, the company that makes it, also makes PyCharm for python. 2. Don't pay for courses. There is more than enough free stuff out there. 3. Feel free to pick up a framework like Symfony/Laravel/etc, but don't confuse the framework for the language. If you're a framework monkey, you're going to have a tough time when something breaks and you don't have the coding skills to figure it out. 4. Don't ignore SQL. Too many devs do so at their peril. Not only is it important for webdev, you might also find that you like it, and there are a lot of high paying jobs in it.,;/1

Eventually pages would get faster. Computers faster, more RAM, faster internet. This will be a problem of the past. All along, however, there have been shit advertisers and inept web design that invalidated progress at every turn. Flash intros, pop ups, wiggling ads, page intros, pages that have to load all the ads before you can read the rest of the headline, infinite redirects, auto refresh, click bait, slide shows, you name it. The internet looks more and more like those ad saver books from the lobby of the grocery store that nobody picks up. Full of crappy ads that all the advertisers think people will somehow see and respond to favorably.

train,;/In my day we didn’t have gradients. You filled a layer with white over an image and set the opacity to 0.85 and liked it.,;/2
train,;/Hey folks! Thought to share a little tip that a designer taught me, which has helped improved readability of text that's overlaid on images. Just apply a simple gradient using black, with about half opacity, up until the point that the text ends, and you will make the text much more readable. And if you want to have more fun, you can use different colored overlays,;/2
train,;/We can use before and after Pseudo-elements too .wrapper{ position:relative; z-index:1; } .wrapper::before{ content:''; position:absolute; background: linear-gradient(0deg, #00000038 30%, #ffffff44 100%); width:100%; height:100%; z-index:-1; left: 0; top: 0; } This code will work too.,;/1

train,;/As a worried American, I’m really glad we’ve got people across the world aware of this insanity. It will quite literally change the way the entire *world* operates on the internet.,;/2
train,;/I just want to point out that net neutrality is only needed because government regulations protect ISPs. If you really want to ensure long-term internet freedom, you'll **fight for deregulation**, which will bring more competition. Hell, if we deregulated it enough we could even have "Mom n Pop" ISPs working together to give us the best internet we've ever had. Fixing government regulations with more government regulations typically doesn't help in the long term and the fact that the net neutrality protections are probably being rolled back now only proves that.,;/1
train,;/rm -f /dev/fcc,;/2
train,;/Stifled innovation, even more ISP monopoly than before, high risk of internet based startups failing as a mainstream competitor can bribe said ISP to deny its users access to your product. In general, not good.,;/2
train,;/Problem is that top government officials in America couldn't care about the insanities affecting people. FCC and Pai have somehow convinced the top bureaucrats that net neutrality is bad, and the government couldn't care less about the people's voice. And these small adverts on little known sites isn't even going to get noticed. Unless there is something like a candle light march or a Boston Tea Party in the making, its not enough to wake them from their deep slumber.,;/2
train,;/Yes and no, IMO. Either we need to go full on public utility (like water/sewer/electricity) or we need to go full deregulation and introduce more competition. I would prefer competition, but if that doesn't work because of how expensive it is to install cable lines then we should treat all ISPs like a natural monopoly and do to them what we've done to other natural monopolies: public utility.,;/2

train,;/I had an interview with Triplebyte a year ago. I am still fuming about it. I passed their 'test' and got to the via video call portion. I built something functional/to their spec in react. I stumbled a little here and there, but the CSS was 90% there and I got through \~80% of the functionality they required in an hour. I got a follow up email saying 'sorry, not good enough. Here is a link to W3 schools and the most basic intros to JS and CSS. Good luck and reach out to us again once you learn the basics. PS, if you know any qualified devs send them our way.' I showed what I built to my senior dev friends and asked if their assessment/recommendations made sense for what I did in an hour - they confirmed that no, I don't need to review what is a variable/array/how to set a background color in CSS.,;/2

train,;/That's how it's done.,;/2
train,;/Exactly this. My company sends a stupid amount of emails per month--I have no clue how many, but I do know that one of our distribution lists 11 million. I think our open rate is in the low teens or even single-digit percentages (keeping in mind that these are from users who subscribed to these emails). Low open rates don't look good to our clients, so every once in a while we will run a "re-engagement" campaign to prune users from our lists and up our open rates.,;/1
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/How do you check opened or not?,;/0
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/Classic trick: you put an `<img>` in the email body, with the `src` pointing at a file hosted on your server. You track requests to that file. Email clients should only request the file once you open the email.,;/1
train,;/Confirmed. Source: I work at the confirmation department in this company and here is our source code: function confirmRemoval(customerEmail){ // Send confirmation email sendRemovalConfirmation(customerEmail); // Confirm that removal was successful if(confirmRemoval(customerEmail)){ return true; } else { // If not removed yet, remove email from mailing list return emailDB.removeCustomer(customerEmail); } },;/1
train,;/Doesn't google mail and the likes now pre-cache images for safety reasons, making this not accurate?,;/0
train,;/> Using cached images is a fine idea for Gmail, but it has the potential to mess with open tracking for ESPs. Fortunately, MailChimp can still detect the first request for the open-tracking pixel. This won’t interfere with the count of “unique opens” you get in your reports, but it could prevent us from seeing multiple opens per subscriber. https://blog.mailchimp.com/how-gmails-image-caching-affects-open-tracking/,;/1

train,;/I hate this and love it at the same time.,;/2
train,;/I'm just happy the coloured pairs all close correctly. Looks good!,;/2
train,;/This is great. I would do three things to add more polish: 1. Move it up incrementally rather than continuously (e.g line by line) 2. Don't start drawing the line at the bottom until it has been given enough space to be drawn 3. Rapidly fade out the line at the top rather than let it get cut off. The invisible cut off line that the text scrolls under is a *bit* jarring since it has the effect of making otherwise uniform line heights, thinner as it moves up. By fading them out, you keep all lines a consistent thickness. I know that the current behavior is how normal text scrolling works, but normally you see exactly where text is disappearing due to a clear bordered window, or the text scrolls up off the top of the monitor. This current text has no "window" that makes it clear where it's scrolling to, and it's in the middle of the page, so it looks a bit odd as is.,;/1
train,;/I really appreaciate that. Beautiful and simple. Could you write some post, to explain how did you do the animation effect?,;/0
train,;/what are the loading times of your app? unless the app is loading huge data and you expect 4-10 second load times, i might speed up the animation so that the user gets the gist of it in just a second or two... assuming that's the kind of load times your system has... otherwise vnice :),;/0

train,;/Thanks. Yeah a post would be good actually, trying to blog more anyways. My attention for the moment is building out the app I built this for, but if I get a few hours I'll put something together and share.,;/2
train,;/it's an Angular 2 app working off a hobby dyno on Heroku. currently the app is about 0.5mb, so depending on the connection it can be a few seconds. Then within the app itself when the user wants to generate a site, the backend has to generate the html. At the moment it's fairly quick but I imagine if the server is getting decent traffic and the designs become more complex then times are likely to get slower. But yeah, relatively trivial to speed it up a tad, might do that. thanks,;/2

train,;/I've always wanted to build something like this, but there was a huge thing back in the day where a redditor created a Chrome Extension called Streamus - it was essentially a YouTube player that skipped over advertisements and hid the video; Google shut that shit down realllll fast whenever they updated their ToS to say videos cannot be hidden for musical listening (the advertisements have to be shown). So... how are you getting around this? Edit 1: Here's a long email chain between YouTube and the developer: https://i.imgur.com/15gaOf6.png Edit 2: I see the video in the bottom left for the YouTube video, but the question about the ads still remain.

train,;/Thank you so much! I hope you find it useful,;/2
train,;/Built with React/Express/Postgresql. Oauth for authenticating with Spotify and YouTube. Then each specific API for getting user data from each different service. It all started with wanting to try making a soundcloud client, then wanting to expand that to other services.

I'd be happy to answer any other questions or specifics!,;/1
train,;/Thanks!! No plans to monetize currently. If I monetized I would have to drop Spotify support anyways or ask for their permission since I accepted their terms of conditions. I thought about adding a donation link if it gains traction though,;/2

train,;/Looks like desktop - but in perspective, my 2013 Macbook Pro Core i5 can hardly run a modern news media website because the ads literally use all the resources. Fans spin up and it gets HOT.

train,;/47 y/o web dev here. Feels like I could have written this. I started a business trying to switch careers and it didn't work out. Still shackled to my desk with golden handcuffs. I don't have any answers, but please have an upvote because i want to see what advice others have.,;/1
train,;/I'm 42, not much older than you, and 5 years ago I was feeling the same about web dev and programming in general. What saved me was the switch from front-end to the back-end world. I don't know your situation but I was lucky enough to be given that opportunity, and boy was it a breath of fresh air. Learning C#, OO programming, .Net Core, how to build APIs and interact with databases, etc. I hadn't experienced that sense of wonder since the start of my career. I know it's not a magical solution, but I'd recommend any burned out web devs out there to give it a try.,;/1
train,;/Hi OP, sorry I'm late to the party. I'm 32, have been a teacher for 6 years, starting my first internship as a Dev this summer and quitting teaching. Why? Money. I can understand your frustration but in a different way. I tell students all the time there are 3 things you need to figure out in life: 1. Hobby or job that makes money 2. Hobby or job that keeps you in shape/healthy 3. Hobby or job that brings you pure joy Don't over complicate it. If you're extremely lucky you find a job that does all 3. If you're really lucky you find a job that does 2 of them. Most of us aren't lucky. Working with kids brings me joy. I'll miss it but I need money for starting a family soon. I can always volunteer to mentor kids to make me happy. Sounds like you have the money but need to spend more time on the joy. Hope this helps. Good luck,;/2
train,;/Sounds like maybe you were expecting too much out of this? I’m about your age but am on career number 3 or 4 rather than having done this forever. I don’t think my job will change the world, I’m not likely to open a text editor in my spare time. My work is work and I do it for the paycheque. On a good day I still take pride in delivering quality product, and on a bad day I implement terrible ideas that I couldn’t talk some stakeholder out of. I’ve had burn out in previous careers, worked long hours and spent too much time thinking what I did day to day was more important than it was. This industry is full of self-importance and cultish like belief in tech. That kind of mindset gets in the way of work life balance, but there’s nothing about the work itself that requires it.,;/1
train,;/I did web development for 11 years. Now I'm a bowling alley mechanic, and I'm genuinely happy with life. Wouldn't mind a better wage, but I enjoy my job, I'm not stuck sitting at a desk all day, I get to interact with people and work with my hands... [and make cool shit.](https://i.imgur.com/bcMGFnS.jpg) Don't be afraid of change. Change is healthy.,;/1
train,;/[removed],;/4
train,;/So far not much, other than "recognize that it's not a calling, it's a paycheck." Which I don't disagree with! But if that's all it is then this is no better than factory work, wasting the best, healthiest, and happiest years of your life learning new JavaScript frameworks to stay relevent enough to keep earning that money. I am glad to hear I'm not the only one that feels this way though.,;/1
train,;/Thanks for the perspective. I did come into it feeling the way you described. I burnt out at the last agency I worked for. I felt like I could do the job better doing it myself, so I started my own company. And I was right. But building quality, modern websites entirely alone does not scale in a way that's good for work-life balance either. I've spent the last two years trying to figure out how to successfully move from a "freelance" to an "agency" model but I've failed miserably. I've spent thousands on training from gurus like Eric Siu trying to make the agency leap the right way, and I just can't seem to get the recipe right. But more importantly I've realized even if I am running my own business, this is STILL totally just a paycheck. If it's not making me happy, I should find a way to earn a paycheck that does, I suppose.,;/1
train,;/Dude, I’m 32 and I already feel this coming on in my life. I’m working on starting my own business in a completely different industry and getting into management so that I’m not competing with all the 18 year olds who are learning 15 new languages and frameworks as they step out of their incubator programs.

Most of all, good luck and stay strong,;/1
train,;/Don't be intimidated by people with flashy tech on their resume at 18. I've met so many bad developers that thought they knew all the languages. Even ones who actually could learn the languages. They lacked experience and application to be able to do anything useful. They are still going to require that stuff until they can have higher level jobs. The problem is that you shouldn't be competing with the 18 year olds out there. You should be focusing on moving to a more mature position -- which it sounds like you're working on. Good luck!,;/2
train,;/You can find the website here [https://andreasbm.github.io/web-skills](https://andreasbm.github.io/web-skills) I created it to help web developers get a visual overview of various skills that can be useful to learn. It is useful for people who just started learning about web development and for people who have been in the field for years and want to learn new things. The skills are based on what I find the most useful in my day to day life. EDIT: I'm so happy to read through all of your messages and see how many of you have found it useful. Thanks for letting me know - it means a lot to me. Also, thanks a lot for the awards, you people are awesome! I totally understand why some of you feel it's a bit overwhelming, but I can assure you that this overview includes MUCH MUCH MUCH more than most people will ever need to know. I'm really not trying to discourage anyone, my goal is to make people hungry for learning more and provide a visual overview. One of the things I absolute LOVE about being a developer is learning new skills. I think it's amazing to be in a field where you can do what you do for a lifetime and still learn something new! As a beginner I would encourage you to not see this website as the definitive list of what you need to know, but as an example of what you can learn and where you can start. This overview is based on a combination of 10 years of experience, a bachelor in software engineering and what I personally find to be the most useful to know on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, you'll notice that it's missing a lot of things. For example, I'm not a PHP developer - because of this, PHP is not included. If you were a PHP developer, this overview would probably look a lot different. If you feel like something important is missing, feel free to make a PR to [https://github.com/andreasbm/web-skills](https://github.com/andreasbm/web-skills). If you have any questions, you are welcome to PM me :-) EDIT 2: I see some of you doesn't like the horizontal scroll, and I totally get it, it's not for everyone. For those of you who don't like scrolling horizontal I've now added a compact mode which is only vertical scroll (default on mobile) :-),;/3
train,;/3 years of experience as a web developer, and I only have an idea about ~40% of this and call myself experienced in 20% so if you're a new comer, don't get intimidated by this,;/2

train,;/Also a web dev here. About a decade in. Its funny because when I see a lot of this stuff I immediately think "front end dev" and not web dev specifically. I'm great with CSS, I can get stuff done in JS, but I have no idea what a lot of this stuff is. I'm a web dev but my focus is in middle/back and most of the tools I use reflect that. The vast majority if what I write executes on the back end and I'm planning on moving straight to WASM with Blazor so while I never really learned anything beyond vanilla JS and JQuery it looks like I'm never going to need to either. It always feels weird seeing these web-dev intros and how little they overlap with what I personally do on a daily basis. 90% of what does apply lists software I've never even heard of and tends to be universally applicable (like unit tests) so most of what does overlap is general dev stuff and not web-dev specifically. Id love to see one of these guides some day that actually covers the kind of work I do but I imagine most new devs aren't really pushing for corporate full stack dev that focuses just as much on internal APIs and applications as it does front-end work. Personally I think its a lot more fun but its not the sort of stuff you tend to see hyped up online. All that being said despite being a web dev im here from /r/all so I don't have a lot of context for this subreddit.,;/1

train,;/Thank you so much! I've been working on it casually for a number of years now, as a hobby project that I've paused and later come back to a few times. It started out as a command-line tool, back in 2016 (can still be used this way if preferred). I later built a GUI around it using Electron, but [had problems with Electron and decided to completely re-write it as a progressive web app](https://mjswensen.com/blog/2019/03/23/from-electron-to-progressive-web-app/) about a year ago. So it's been off and on for quite a while now 🙂,;/2

train,;/I'll fork it for the comic sans version!,;/2
train,;/StackOverflow is super toxic for old developers too. I've had comments altered by mods for no good reason, years after I've written them, and for what? Just because the person had moderator abilities and wanted to reword what I said? It leaves a really bad impression on me when my words with my name and picture beside it can (and are) just altered whenever by whoever has the ability to moderate. Yuck!,;/2
train,;/You're just using the wrong strategy. When I was a new developer someone taught me the secret. You can't just post the question you want the answer to. That gets you nowhere. Instead, post the code you want fixed with some stupid question. Brag about how awesome your code is and even question why dumb developers don't use the techniques you are employing. The more condescending the better. The way you should phrase your question must incorporate blaming other developers for your problem like, "How do I make my awesome code work with this idiot's shitty excuse for an API that I'm required to use because my boss is a dumb ass." Then post your code. Your code will be tuned to perfection by angry devs everywhere. They will explain every piece of it to you likely in the most easy to understand (think condescending) way they can because you're an idiot noob who thinks their code is actually good. This will not be a nice explanation, but will be super clear to make sure you understand what an idiot you are. Plus, you will get every finely tuned code snippet possible to fix your solution. You just have to ignore all the mean shit the devs say to take you down a peg. Ask an honest question as a new developer, expect one of two things to happen: crickets or an insult about how you didn't bother to search for the answer.,;/1
train,;/I've found it's in response to being flooded by new devs, most of which ask really poor questions. They're aware and they've revamped their ToS and guidelines (and added a 'new member, be nice' icon). Unfortunately the wheat in the chaff are immediately branded as suspicious because they are new. It takes a quite a bit of effort on your question to avoid getting immediately downvoted. Plus they removed the ability to put comments like: "What have you tried?" and just suggest "downvote and move on" which seem counter to their new initiative.,;/1
train,;/I had a highly rated question that had over 20k views and hundreds of upvotes rated as too subjective.....4 years after it was submitted.,;/2
train,;/sometimes i see my answers/questions being edited and i think, "oh yeah, i guess they're right, my question really could have been condensed down from 3 paragraphs to 1: all of that extra background information wasn't really necessary." but other times it's more like, "why did you need to change those two words? it doesn't change the meaning of the question at all. why do you even care?",;/1
train,;/This technique was, and may still be, well employed by new Linux users. If you asked "How do I do xyz in Linux?" you wouldn't get nearly the number of "helpful" replies as the person who said "Linux sucks, you can't even do xyz. It's dead simple in Windows!",;/2
train,;/[https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s\_Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law), if you want a name for it. Although your explanation was definitely way funnier than this one.,;/4
train,;/That's the thing, I see a lot of "low effort questions", but at the same time I remember when I was just starting it wasn't that it was low effort, I didn't know how to make a proper question (English not being my first language adds some complexity too).,;/2
train,;/Because editing is something that gives you points and is one of the only ways for new accounts to gain permissions for things like commenting and voting.,;/2

train,;/Really cool idea! Although I think the animation needs to be almost instant since some people just want to peak at their password real quick,;/1
train,;/I coded this here! [https://codepen.io/zackkrida/pen/gObRyoE](https://codepen.io/zackkrida/pen/gObRyoE) Did it quick and dirty, and definitely color contrast issues with the original but still fun to implement.,;/3
train,;/From an accessibility standpoint the purple on black has a contrast issue, though you're only ever displaying dots on the black background. Additionally I would suggest not using placeholder text as a label, and ensure the label is always displayed. Now on to the good: I love the animation to show the password. The speed is good and it looks very fluid. Great job! Edit: icon is not purple on black. Removed comment.,;/1
train,;/Very appealing visually, but outright changing the color of the text field is likely to cause confusion about focus location, and generally seems like a risky design idea. If you could do a faster animation which just expanded a circular border out like a scan line to reveal the value without changing the color, perhaps that would be less likely to cause issues. Sometimes the prettiest designs are not safe for use, but often the concept can be salvaged and made accessible.,;/1
train,;/Shouldn't the two eye icons be swapped? If I click on the eye icon it means I want to see it. And for the closed eye I want to hide it? Really cool animation though,;/0
train,;/It's a cool idea, and I get where you're coming from, however for UI standards, this is incorrect. Many people won't know what that button does by default. Edit: I meant how the icon is shown, not everyone will see it's a closed eye. I understand your arguments that an eye is already used on some password fields, which is correct, however for them it's an eye that is open with a slash through it, which would be more understood to a larger audience.,;/1
train,;/Meet in the middle, we should definitely see the animation, but we shouldn't have to wait for it. Yes the text toggles instantly, but it's barely readable on the dark background. Very cool idea!,;/1
train,;/> Shouldn't the two eye icons be swapped? If I click on the eye icon it means I want to see it. I feel like there is no consensus on this kind of thing across the web. Even with things like expand/collapse arrows. Should it show the current state or the desired state? No idea...,;/1
train,;/I would say that really depends on the audience. For any app/account that comes from gov etc. units and should meet the highest standards of accessibility, there should be a checkbox/toggle outside the input with a label clearly stating it will reveal the password. If this app is for a teens-millenials group with a high it literacy then this eye icon is fine, it's commonly used/well known symbol. Also if interface is not too crowded with interactive elements (and login page should be free from distractions) then users will simply worked it out on their own.,;/1
train,;/That’s because the UI is trying to combine the role of a status and a command into one UI element. This is why it’s generally recommended to provide labels rather than letting the icon be stand alone.,;/1

train,;/For anyone wondering, this was coded using WebGL. Bare WebGL is quite low-level in itself, but has been abstracted upon by libraries such as Three.js and PIXI.js. If you want to learn how to code something like this, you should learn how to code **shaders**. Shaders are essentially small programs written in GLSL that run directly on your GPU (you can see quite a few examples in this GitHub author's JS file).

train,;/Are people just unaware of the third party apps and that they are (or at least, most of them are) better than the official reddit app?,;/0
train,;/It's not just the constant app popups (which are intentionally confusingly worded). * It cycles the "loading" icon waaay longer than it needs to now. The loading icon intentionally prevents any already loaded content from being shown until it's "done". * It limits the amount of comments you can see and forces a reload when expanding them (retriggering the loading icon and app popups). * The other day I went and it literally wouldn't let me load more comments. It required the app. Like the paywall of Washington Post or NYT. I've only had that happen once but it seems like a new method they're trying or maybe moving toward. It's gotten to the point where I actively don't click on reddit when doing web searches. Even if it seems to have an answer to something I'm looking for. Unfortunate since the mobile web experience is a big part of what, I think, got reddit a lot of its popularity. It was refreshing compared to all the other sites that were a hassle. Now it's just one of those. Edit: Oh, and if we're suggesting apps, I love Slide on Android! It's really nice (and open source too!) RedReader is another really nice open source one too!,;/1
train,;/Http://old.reddit.com Best mobile experience for me.,;/1
train,;/The issue is Reddit making the mobile site unusable in a mobile browser in an obvious attempt to force those people to use their app. It’s a really shitty, scummy ass maneuver. And this does effect 3rd party app users as well because sometimes a link will open in say chrome or safari, redirect to the site thread, and force open the official app (if you have it installed) and open the App Store if you don’t. It’s like back in the old days when mobile browsers were just starting out, you would request a mobile site and the web server would flip out and go “*oh! I have a mobile version of the site do you want to see it?”* you say yes and it dumps you to the sites front page losing the article you wanted to read. Reddit use to work great on mobile browsers, they intentionally killed it to push their app and it’s a real shit practice.,;/2

train,;/It's now called "rif is fun" because they couldn't actually use the name "reddit" for the app,;/1
train,;/this is what a lot of people asking for help around reddit need to realize. i’ve seen questions with a 1000 line long code snippet asking why “it’s not working”. people tend to get upset when this is met with unhelpful responses. if you can’t boil your issue down to a few lines of reproducible bug code, you probably don’t understand it that well either. you need to go learn what each thing does as you go or you won’t be able to confidently speak on these subjects,;/1
train,;/Being able to learn new and unknown tech by yourself is the most important skill to have as a dev. What is the standard way of doing things now will be, if not obsolete, at the very least legacy in 5 years. Once you have the basic knowledge to kickstart your ability to learn a new tech/language/technique, you can be any dev you want to be.,;/1
train,;/Counter point. Just because something is the way it is doesn’t mean it should or has to be that way. A lot of research into teaching and learning has shown that a number of important elements needed for effective learning are completely unknown or unused by many if not almost all educators and learners. Take expert blind spot problem. This is the most common issue for junior programmers, experts actually can’t teach well because there’s many foundational concepts needed to be learnt first but experts are so far removed from it that they don’t even acknowledge or consider teaching it. This is why many tutorials, documentation, stackoverflow answers etc just are super difficult for beginners to understand. And the hardest bit is beginners don’t know or understand this because they don’t know what they don’t know. Another issue is the cognitive overload issue, juniors can’t process as much information as experts until they become super comfortable and automate a lot of that information (think learning to drive vs being a comfortable driver). I agree the reality is you have to just wade through the mess and uncertainty and get to the other side. But I don’t like to perpetuate the idea that this is just the way it is and always will be. We all can do things to change this, all seasoned and experience developers can work to make the lives of juniors easier so they don’t have to go through what we did. Things don’t have to be the way they are, just because that’s how they are.

train,;/I want to be a firetruck dev.,;/2
train,;/I kinda agree with this, also just because you have finished the project doesn't mean you understand how it works. It would have been better if the professor taught you how to think independently and/or how to better approach problems, not just "Yeah you're supposed to do this alone, you will learn faster that way". Some people without background of any logical subject and/or people who were not taught how to think independently will just fold, and is that really how we're supposed to approach them?,;/2
train,;/> Sometimes all it takes is spending five minutes actually debugging. The amount of people that don’t even debug blows my mind. Yup, a lot of problems have relatively straightforward solutions. Knowing how to the find problem is a much bigger job than engineering solutions.

train,;/Good idea! Might look into it in the future :),;/2
train,;/Yeah, honestly, if it was to be any use, it'd have to be more interactive and show the actual effects. Like if I do a reset or a rebase – show which commit (or specifically which changes to my repository) this would do. Just explaining each parameter individually isn't worth much to me at least. What's the difference between my local branch and the remote branch? Which commits are deleted, which are commited? Or what caused me to be in this distached state and how can I get back in a sane way? I love that OP is doing that and I'm not ever going to put somebody down for contributing to the community. I'm just stating what I'd need as a seasoned developer. But hey, maybe this tool isn't intended for me, and that's fine. But I'd love a tool that did do these things. (And just to preemtively stop people from trying to help me with issues: Yes, I'm not currently stuck in one of these, yes, usually just doing `git reset FETCH_HEAD` will put me in the state I want. I just mean... On the rare occasion, I'm lost, these are the information I'd want.) So anyway, I'd love checking back in a while – every great project starts with a single commit. Good job!,;/2

train,;/Resoume is a project I have been working on for a bit over a year now. It started as a resume builder but the bigger picture I had in mind was a platform to build your online presence for the job search. You can now create a resume, portfolio and personal website with analytics. **What is so great about it?** Well, I am surprised that with something like a resume builder, where you have a ton of competition, I could still get a decent amount of traction and revenue. But the best part is the things I have learned by building this platform. With more and more complex features that I added to the platform, I created more and more code and learnings that I can re-use for other projects. Certain parts, like sign-in/sign-up, email subscriptions, subdomain support, payment solution just to name a few, are now my boilerplate for my next project. Build something like no one cares. At worst, you have another project for your resume (pun intended) and learned a lot of new and interesting things along the way ✌️ If you are curious, you can check it out here: [resoume.com](https://resoume.com/) Edit: Thank you all for your feedback and support and kind words!!! This got way more attention than I thought it would. I love to work on Resoume (I think you can tell by just looking at it) but to see other people appreciate it as well is an amazing feeling ❤️ I decided to build in public and if you would like to follow along here is my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gobienan) Edit2: The r/webdev Community motivated me so much that I will make the leap and post Resoume on ProductHunt. I decided to do it on the 3rd of April 2021. It would be amazing if you could drop by and leave an upvote. And if you really, really like me maybe even a positive comment 🥰,;/2
train,;/Thanks a lot! It was indeed a lot of work but I am really proud that I stuck with something for so long.

train,;/You are genius. I excited. So curious to know more about it,;/2
train,;/Holy shit this is impressive! Why did you choose to go vanilla js? How long you been working on this? The meme potential is wild with this,;/0
train,;/Dude is a Facebook engineer. And studied at Carnegie Mellon. These type of people don't post on Showoff Saturday, they go directly to VCs.,;/1
train,;/It didn't seem like I needed any libraries and I wanted to brush up on newer JS standards. I was pleasantly surprised by how much browsers can do out of the box. I started last Friday as a long weekend project. Polished it up this week.,;/1
train,;/Thanks for making such a cool project! &#x200B; How much would you say you spent like percentage wise on brushing up on the new standards, planning things outs, rough development, and polish?,;/0
train,;/I first spent time playing with standards, which was basically copying and pasting StackOverflow examples and getting really inspired. That was maybe \~20% of the time. Building out the project was another 30% of the time. (Design didn't take long as it's just two concepts: a `Player` and `Layer`s equipped with a `render` method). Then I squashed bugs and polished with small features. This took up the remaining 50%. Canvas rendering (all the resizing, placement and mouse detection logic) was the hardest bit.,;/1
train,;/I'm the guy that made this, so I'll try to answer the question. This was just a project that I did for fun. I like to explore some of the weird and unorthodox ideas that pop into my head sometimes. I also work a lot in SVG and I wanted to see if was possible to pull the effect off the way that I wanted. I had seen a similar login for a company called RememBear that had a bear that looked left and right as the user types. I'm not positive, but in my quick exploration of that effect at the time, it looked like it essentially switched to different frames of a pre-rendered sequence as each character was entered. I was curious if I could make one that animated dynamically in realtime at precise angles to what it was looking at. I also wanted to see if I could use 2D elements to fake a believable 3D effect of a 3-dimensional face that turns and moves. I drew the graphics in Adobe Illustrator and exported them as SVG. I then inlined the SVG to the page and gave each element I needed to interact with an ID. I used JavaScript to get the text cursor position on each keystroke. Then, using some trigonometry, I can get the angle between the position of the face and that cursor position. From there, it's just a matter of moving the SVG elements along that angle. I used a JS library called GreenSock to do the animation, but you could use another library or even vanilla JS is your preferred. Hope that helps, let me know if anyone has follow-up questions.,;/1
train,;/Learn how to animate svg elements and then trigger these animations based on user input events (click, focus, keyup/keydown),;/1
train,;/The first and most difficult step: have a sense of humour. The rest is easy triggered based animation. Probably took an hour if the graphics are prepared,;/2
train,;/My guess is that you must ask yourself this question: *"What would bring a* ***moment of delight*** *for my users"?* The answer to this question is very *open-ended* and that would enable you to think of limitless ideas that are fresh and unique. And then you run along and figure out how to accomplish it.,;/1
train,;/This was done by Darin Senneff. You should look at the code used to create it. He makes things like this a lot a publishes them on Codepen. https://codepen.io/dsenneff/pen/2c3e5bc86b372d5424b00edaf4990173,;/1

train,;/The thing that always seems to be pure trial and error for me is "flex-basis". E.g. flex: 1 0 50%; So, you can grow but don't shrink and you start at 50% width. Result: boxes take size of contents and are 15% and 42% width. Ok, flex: 0 0 50% ; You can neither grow nor shrink and should be 50% width. Result: boxes are 100% and wrap to next line.

And frankly the finger waving in the articles about people not doing accessibility is kinda tiresome (not the case here with OP) / I swear to god I've read some conflicting information.... There's a lot of "oh it's the standard / in HTML" or whatever but that means jack shit when you go to layout a page or make a form or whatever ....,;/1

My wife can't even be in the same room with me if I don't have my headphones on because I listen at 2x+ most of the time depending on the speed the person talks. It drives her crazy because she can't comprehend what they are saying at that speed and it sounds so unnatural. Edit: it is however a learned skill I compare it to her speed reading. She reads way faster than me. Also with accessibility feature such as screen readers. You are often not trying to deeply comprehend what is being said. Most of the time you just trying to hear the difference between the sound it makes when you hover the Twitter icon vs the Gmail icon. So you can think of it as a specific tone for each app, unless you have never heard it before then your brain can take the time to process it. That said I would love if screen readers were a little smarter and would speed up or slow down based on the size of the block of text. So if it is reading an app name it reads at 4x, but if it's reading a book then it reads at 2x.,;/1

train,;/Self-promotion: https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/547qum/anyone_know_of_a_codeacademy_or_freecodecamp_like/,;/1
train,;/We don't take kindly to purveyors of physical activity here, and this person appears to run a free code CAMP,;/2
train,;/Perma-banning someone who runs a website as well-known as FreeCodeCamp, in a subreddit for web developers and up-and-comers seems a bit harsh. After a few years, unban him. Jeez, I'm sure he learnt his lesson, whatever he did. Nobody needs any answers.,;/2
train,;/And everyone who commented *oh shi-*,;/2
train,;/This. Checking his account history, back about 5 years, almost every post or comment he made in r/webdev either mentioned why FCC is amazing, or linking directly to it, or linking to Medium articles that promote FCC. His claim of wanted to answer questions is pretty hollow; he never did before, it was just a prompt to promote his platform rather than actually educate or assist with any substance. Self-promotion - even for a free resource - is not well-regarded here on Reddit. Ultimately, it comes down to what the Mods can tolerate. As his platform is already well known, and he was contributing in no meaningful way in the subreddit - along with blatant self-promotion - apparently it wasn't a good balance. Perma-ban seems harsh though. But we have to take him on his word that he wasn't previously warned or contacted since by the Mods,;/1

train,;/I saw a project a little while ago, where I discovered that the time (in format 00:00:00) works perfectly for hexadecimal codes.

train,;/Now make a time-picker control that's just a color wheel. :),;/2
train,;/Hey! I feel like a lot of people don't know about it, but there's a built-in string function that can ensure the length of a string, and you can supply it a character to fill out the empty with string.padStart(2, "0"); // "2" will be "02" // "10" will be "10" so voila: const pad = t => String(t).padStart(2, "0") const clock = document.querySelector("#clock"); setInterval(() => { today = new Date(); hex = "#" + pad(today.getHours()) + pad(today.getMinutes()) + pad(today.getSeconds); clock.innerText = hex; document.body.style.backgroundColor = hex; }, 1),;/2

train,;/SQL joins,;/3
train,;/As someone who has been writing code for uh, a while. I still find myself sometimes just trying out left, right, outer join types until I get the result I was looking for. I mean, like 90% of the time it is just a left join but those edge cases can chew up a bit of time.,;/2
train,;/[A case against illustrating SQL operations using venn diagrams](https://blog.jooq.org/2016/07/05/say-no-to-venn-diagrams-when-explaining-joins/),;/3
train,;/I just started learning SQL and the lesson explains SQL joins with these. Honestly I found it more confusing than just showing the output in the table.,;/2
train,;/INNER and OUTER keywords are a waste of characters IMO. there is no full inner join and there is no left inner join...,;/2
train,;/If you can understand and agree with this argument then you don't need these graphics.,;/2
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/From the top of the mountain looking down, that makes a solid case. From the bottom looking up, wtf? This is because venn diagrams and new learners naively assume the existence of a shared unique key between both sets. This is why my venn has US States in them. &#x200B; |Pacific States|Intersection|States w/ 10+ Representatives| |:-|:-|:-| |CA, WA, OR, AK, HI|WA, CA|WA, CA, IL, TX, OH, FL, GA, MI, PA, NY, NJ| Thinking about joins without such a key is a whole different animal.,;/2
train,;/Right? I'm perfectly fine with explanations that are good for beginners even while not being 100% correct, but these diagrams always made fuckall sense to me...,;/2
train,;/Also RIGHT is useless as you can just flip it around as a LEFT join. And cross join is rarely needed. So you end up with JOIN, LEFT JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN and that's pretty much all you need 90% of the time.,;/1

train,;/There was a time were I was always looking for what kind of project to do. and they are fun, but if you are a beginner, before projects on general, learn first how to TEST. Better, learn how to TDD. Think as testing as a way to ensure that you are actually providing a code that you can read later, others may look and understand you reasoning and most important, you will have to learn how to document your code and project. This will force you to learn how to build quality software (MIT 6.005 course is available in two modules @ edx - Software construction with java and advanced software construction with java) and consider your choices while developing your code. if you can stick to the testing first (TDD) approach, your projects will be more logical, will most likely be corrected and your code will look more professional without effort.,;/1

train,;/What a goldmine. Thank you.,;/2
train,;/He means writing unit tests. If you write a function like “sum(x, y)” that returns them added together, you write a test to make sure when you pass it a random x and y, you get back the sum. Google unit testing for more info,;/1
train,;/Hey thank you for this but if I do a project on that list is it good to put in my GitHub account ??,;/0

train,;/Some relatable example on reflection api would be cherry on cake,;/2
train,;/This is awesome! I’m only in the beginner stages in my coursework but seeing fun applications of the concepts makes me really excited to continue. Definitely saving for when my ability reaches the level where I can understand these.,;/2
train,;/Bookmark for later.,;/2
train,;/Thats a good question, I'm not sure. I put my homework on github. I would think that if you add a comment to the file saying which project these files are based on so that it's clear you're just working through someone elses project, that it would be okay.,;/2
train,;/I added stuff based on such projects to my GitHub. For example, the project may be something like a to-do list. Well I expand on it, add other functionality and then I can put it on GitHub, so that I can point to what I did on my own without following the initial project.,;/2
train,;/I'm no expert Im still learning, but I've heard that if you follow a tutorial to put your own twist on it and make it do something special other than just what is shown in the tutorial. Chances are that most other applicants would be following similar tutorials so employers would be seeing the same thing several times but if yours is different then it stands out! For example, instead of following the flashlight app and having it be able to turn on/off, maybe add the ability to make it flash in patterns or be able to change the brightness (if that's possible on whatever phone is using it?),;/2
train,;/I give homework a pass because my implementation of the project specs is usually vastly different than my classmates. And we aren’t show how to do anything These YouTube tutorials usually shown you exactly the code to run the project,;/2
train,;/Great roadmap! But I'm wondering.. if you mastered all 3 parts wouldn't that qualify you as a full blown java developer? I've got hired as a junior with only covering 2 bullet points from part 1.. this is just fuelling my imposter syndrome 😳,;/0

train,;/I appreciate your work. Will use this road map.,;/2
train,;/Thanks for the reading,;/2
train,;/Very good post. I made note of your blog and glad I came across this post just now. As you said, a lot of people learn basic Java and then jump right into a framework like Spring, which is exactly what I found myself doing. Now, I will spend some time going through some of the lower level stuff in part I to get an idea of what is going on behind the scenes before I jump into a framework.,;/2
train,;/3 main paths you have Backend, mobile, Android. Then right after you have backend, Android, desktop. Which one is it? Also, Google uses kotlin does that mean it's the industry standard or will be?,;/0
train,;/I am curious, where are you finding jobs like this? Are the standards really that low in this industry? In my opinion, someone can learn basic Java (input/output, conditionals, loops, arrays, etc) in a weekend if they really wanted. Are there really junior positions that are willing to hire somebody with experience that you can gain in less than a week? Thanks.,;/0
train,;/After passing Associate, how long does it take to pass Professional exam if you study diligently?,;/0
train,;/I'm working for the german government. The standards here aren't that low and most private companies just ignored me. But to be fair, I was employed as a sysadmin for 5 years before switching into the public sector and having experience with powershell scripting/toolbuilding, databases and also some php sure helped. I also know how to sell myself and they thought I would be the perfect social fit for the team. Its not always your skill that counts but your passion and ability to socialise. Now I'm learning on the job and couldn't be happier. Better working hours, way more pay, work-life balance I couldn't have dreamed of and near zero responsibility.,;/1
train,;/You rock,;/2
train,;/Great work! This is a great cheat sheet! You could add: - for each loop with Map.Entry - default: in switch-case,;/1
train,;/Few remarks: * You should 'program against the interface'. So `List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();` * Stack and Queue are outdated deprecated collections, like Vector and HashTable. Both Stack and Queue functionality is in the [Deque](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html) interface (pronounced Deck), with for example the ArrayDeque as concrete implementation. * Having another try-catch block inside a finally is generally considered a bad practice. Avoid that. * Arrays.asList doesn't turn it into an "ArrayList", at least not java.util.ArrayList. I'd rephrase it to just List instead. You also seem to have based this cheatsheet on old pre-Java 8 information. So lambda's and default interface methods for example are missing. Not to mention all the things added between 9 and 15. I'd definitely recommend to, if you want this to be a 'complete' cheatsheet, add those too.,;/1

You could also try something like a simple `ternary operator` which is the same control structure as a simple if/else block. return age == 0b11110 ? celebrate() : insertButtPlug(); Which is the same as saying in English, "If your age is equal to 30, then celebrate.

train,;/That's exactly the reason why we don't have it in the recommended learning resources. The single best starter course is the MOOC [Object Oriented Programming with Java](http://mooc.fi/en) from the University of Helsinki.,;/1
train,;/> When it came to OOP, I was banging my head to the wall, trying to understand what he was saying. That's nearly everybody. It's a poorly explainable concept in general. It's always done non-practical examples and jargon-y terminology. I'm going on decades now of "learning to program" and I often time barely get the point of using OOP. Or rather some of the concepts I dont think I ever will or one can fully grasp utnil you need to make a complex program that involves *other people* outside yourself participating on your program(s). That being said I pretty much finished breezing thru the the "Java for Complete Beginners" by Cave of Programming recommended in the sidebar. It was very useful to me. I dont know if all beginner's still since I had an advantage of being familiar with various bits of programmimg from multi-decade failure lol. Also, I'm up this early because I've been reading selected Chapters of Head First Java 2nd Edition. That's been a really good help too. Surprisingly, well done from what I read. I actually appreciated a few of the extended non-essential sidebar explanations, ( although theyre definitely jargon-y too but theyre at a level that can be understood by potential CompSci students. and since it's in the non-essential portions you can probably skip over them),;/1
train,;/fuck man, And i was here thinking i am just an idiot. I abandoned his course long ago, after trying multiple times to get thru. I learned better by creating projects and thru oracle's documentation.,;/2
train,;/Damn, thank you! I thought I was one of the few who was having this problem with learning this course. I spent months learning/trying to learn through that course, in the end I gave up. &#x200B; I was giving top priority to app dev at that time, now I'm in game dev and I even feel motivated with coding (although in another language). I felt like I've wasted so much time trying to learn through that course. And I even recommended that course because at the beginning it seemed so nice. Big mistake.,;/1
train,;/I had the same feeling when taking his course and expressed it one or two times in this sub. To me the explanation was so very confusing, hectic and sometimes irrelevant that I canceled the course and got a refund. There are better courses on Udemy about this topic or youtube.,;/1
train,;/I think understanding the concept of OOP requires lots and lots of practice by writing OOP code and then learn by improving it on each iteration. The code will probably be horrible from an initial perspective, but you'll slowly get better once you start churning out more and more applications written in OOP. If you can get a Book and learn the concept of OOP from there, and try to do the [MOOC.fi](http://mooc.fi/english.html) from the University of Helsinki (which is an excellent resource) btw, you'll get a good amount of practice. Also designing classes, and figuring it out which shoudl be the parent class, child class or what are the interfaces and abstract classes requires experience and intuition about the underlying system you're designing. You'll likely refactor your code several times and then arrive at a OOP design and take takes time to learn. Hope it helps!,;/1
train,;/Actually going through his course now, also had to do the same as you where I would find his explanation confusing. He often talks about a complex subject saying things in the most jargony, and roundabout fashion possible. Im not even at OOP section yet, and I've had to several times go and find another video which explained the subject better than he did. I also find it very annoying where he would start explain something and then say that actually we will learn about that in a later part, well why bring it up now?! While i'm trying to understand something else your just adding more things to the pile in a haphazard fashion. Some of the challenges he sets are confusing as well because he explains what he wants poorly. Its head banging against the wall frustrating, and based on what everyone here says I may just find a different source!,;/1
train,;/Speaking of which, the sidebars have not been updated yet for the new course,;/1
train,;/Wish I knew about MOOC (GREAT FOR BEGINNERS) before I started the Java Masterclass Program on Udemy. Tim Buchalka does a decent job explaining the basics, but OP is right on point when he says Tim starts getting extremely confusing when Object Oriented Program lessons start. His exercises for those are trash and WAY TOO VAGUE. There is absolutely no direction and you pretty much have to make a whole goddamn function from scratch,;/1
train,;/I ended up buying a book “Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach (4th Edition)” by Stuart Reges. A golden book IMHO. Lots of easy to challenging exercises on every subject. The way they explain concepts and do a relatively major project at the end of evey chapter worth commending. Now I’m doing leetcode problems (although easy and medium ones).,;/1

train,;/As a js developer decide to give Java a shot to have better understanding for OOP and data structures, did one free udemy Java course and now going through this. Couldn't reccommend it enough. Generally learning Java boosted my programming skills since I'd say only learning Js was limiting my knowledge on some concepts and hell even knowong SOLID principes of oop helps in improving my front end skills in some way.

That way there is a sense of progression as you go from step 1 to step 150? Regardless, this is an amazing resource! The JVM definitely makes Java a bit trickier to dive into (compared to JS, Python, and Go in my personal experience) so starting with jshell was an inpired choice!,;/0

train,;/Wow that was super helpfull.Do you have any familiar resources?Thanks.,;/0
train,;/\- May want to talk about how classes may implement as many interfaces as they want. \- May want to talk about why ThreadLocal makes thread-safety easier. Bottomline, it just allows to fetch back some variables without having to keep passing these variables (which may be seen as cumbersome) or keeping these variables in an accessible object (which may be cumbersome or not thread-safe). static also allows to fetch back variables from anywhere, but static variables are accessible from any thread which is therefore not thread-safe. A static ThreadLocal variable, on the other hand, allows to fetch that variable from anywhere, but each different thread works with its own dedicated variable without an access to the others'. One example would be DateFormat and how they change their own state when they do their work, thus making them not thread-safe. A statically built and accessible DateFormat will likely cause weird errors. The same DateFormat kept through a ThreadLocal and newly built for each new thread, won't have this problem. Of course, a better practice is to use newer java.time APIs, and before that, to just build a new DateFormat whenever you need one. It's cheap. Still, ThreadLocal helps in less trivial cases. \- Beware that singleton is an antipattern and some people will try and see if you notice that. If you only want one instance of an object, then don't make more than one. Duh. That wasn't complicated. The Singleton antipattern, on the other hand, gets in the way of integrating with other frameworks, and with mocking the singleton sanely enough. \- Note that the use for "native" methods isn't so much a matter of some functionalities being restricted to other *languages*, but rather to non-Java *libraries*. Other languages typically don't have better magical access to what needs to be done, and instead need to call some library code that was put there directly as machine code/assembly. In reality that will mostly amount to trigger a call to kernel routines, which is highly dependent on the system's architecture. And maaaybe to preparing the parameters for that routine and a pointer to it, which admittedly a language like C has its chances to do properly.,;/1
train,;/What always tripps me is that Java is supposed to be Pass by Value, but shouldn't it more correct to say it's Pass by Reference except for primitive objects? Because if I pass a method an argument and an change made to that argument is still there outside of the method it must be pass by Reference or?,;/0
train,;/I'm also looking for jobs as a senior gradating next spring and this was a really good read. Thank you,;/2
train,;/Thanks for sharing this. Are you applying for junior java developer position? Good luck!,;/0
train,;/Thanks! Very glad you liked it. Not really, I tried to add a few at the very end. But its been many more resources, I guess.,;/2
train,;/Thanks you! Really appreciate your feedback! These are good points. I'd like to add them as soon as I can. Yes, I am aware of these singleton antipattern discussions - In this case I'd try to be as neutral as possible since this is more about knowledge than opinions. I think its still worth to know the concept at least. In an interview situation I would share my opinion, although I have to admit that I didn't have too bad experiences with singletons so far.,;/2
train,;/I used to think this as well until I read Core Java Vol. 1. For example if Java was truly pass by reference: Object original = new Object(2); // outputs 2 changeObject(original); public static void changeObject(Object object) { object = new Object(4); // original is still 2 } The above code should change the original to 4, but if you run it, it'll still be 2. This is because Java copies the value of the reference of the object but does not exactly point to the exact address in memory like how pointers work in C++. If this worked exactly like in C++ where there is pass by reference, original should have changed to 4, but it does not. Idk if that makes sense or if I explained that right, but that's what I got from reading the book.,;/1
train,;/You're welcome! Thank you very much! I don't care too much about titles - more importantly, it fits me in terms of content and environment. Any specific reasons for asking? Is it somehow related to this post?,;/0
train,;/Of course it's worth knowing about it, more relevantly, it's true that you may be asked about them in an interview after all (and admittedly if you are, it's more likely that the interviewer uses it). It's just it is a pain in the ass to remove all the singleton antipatterns from a project when it needs to be merged with a new framework, or to find workarounds for when they'd better be mocked. That's unlikely to be discussed in an interview though. Now obviously, you wouldn't have bad experiences with singletons, as singletons are fine: they're object instances of classes of which you don't make other instances because you only need one. It's everywhere in application design. Services will usually be singletons. Singleton antipattern, though, even if one never found to have much problem with it, it's not like they brought anything of value either.,;/2
train,;/As simple as: > “There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.” > Bjarne Stroustrup Every programming language has its haters. Java is no exception to that. Some of the haters were not capable of learning Java, some haven't even tried, some got used to working with "more convenient" languages, and others just jump on the hate train. Sorry for the following rude language, but it is best not to give a single fuck about the haters and to just ignore them. (In fact, quite a large number does not even know what they are talking about.) Yes, Java has its flaws. Yet, it is the #1 enterprise programming language for exactly the reasons you mention. Java is often considered a "boring" language - which is exactly what enterprise development needs. It is a rock solid language with a very mature, extremely huge ecosystem. Java is not moving as fast as other, more modern, more hyped languages, which is due to the fact that Java tries to maintain as much backward compatibility as feasible and also because it has to remain rock stable. Since Java is used in absolutely mission critical programs where the smallest instability could cause huge losses, the Java maintainers decided to move slower. Java is not flashy. It is just a silent, quite efficient work horse. Zero reasons to actually hate Java.,;/1
train,;/There are arguments for the "hate" Java gets but it's not a generalization, people hate C/C++/Python/.Net/JS for reasons as well because people are by nature haters 1. There are Linux devs that only like stuff in C, there are windows devs that only like stuff in .net etc. Refusal to accept that a language can do different things is one point 2. Java can be confusing, for example: what is the difference between JSP, JSF, JavaEE, JPA, Spring, SpringBoot etc. These frameworks / libraries / technologies can be confusing as hell for a beginner 3. Legacy code and xml hell. Before we had Annotations that simplify the work of configuring beans we had something like &#8203; <bean id="country" class="org.arpit.java2blog.model.Country"> <constructor-arg index="0" value="India"></constructor-arg> <constructor-arg index="1" value="20000"></constructor-arg> </bean> All cool and simple if you read a little about spring. Until you apps becomes 200 classes and your xml configuration is a sea of hopeless text 4) Too verbose Python: print "Hello" Java: public static void main(String[] args){ System.out.println("Already bored!"); } >is there still a future for java? Java won't go anywhere anytime soon so if you are asking if it's ok to learn Java the answer is yes. In 2020 we have better IDE (and I refer to Intellij, God help the ones with eclipse or netbeans) better frameworks and a lot of learning materials,;/1

train,;/You can also take a look into hyperskill. Hyperskill allows you to choose a project and guides you into completion. You have four difficulties: easy, medium, hard and challenging. Good luck :),;/1
train,;/whichever, I prefer leetcode but as long as you find challenging problems, its all good, you just need to keep your brain churning, also don't look too deep into this stuff, which framework is better than which one, which chair, which desk, which mechanical keyboard, which cherry switch, which whatever is better than the other one, they usually have their use cases and a 100 other things. if you know what i mean.,;/1
train,;/I find leetcode a little more user friendly because it's easier to create your own test cases in the ui but other than that they both (in part) use very well known problems from computer science. They're all good. Another tip: In Hackerrank you usually have to submit your solution along with the main method. To boost speed you can use BufferedReader instead of Scanner if it is used. There is a testcase in a problem (Dijkstra's Algorithm) where the time limit is exceeded if you use Scanner instead of BufferedReader,;/1
train,;/I quite like CodeWars, I wouldn't say it's much better or worse than LeetCode for problems but I prefer the aesthetic.,;/1
train,;/It might also be worth to check out the [community resource thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/md1loc/community_resources/).,;/3
train,;/* For when you are starting out- Codewars and Exercism. Exercism is CLI based and you can write code in your local machine and push it to the website directly from your CLI.

Same goes for CodeChef. * Leetcode for interview preparation related to DSA. * Cofeforces, Atcoder, SPOJ, UVAOJ, etc. for *hardcore* DSA feel. Take your pick based on where you are.

train,;/Yeah I really found this to be true. What I recon lately is that there is too much discussion about the "best" and "optimal" approach to something, instead of just trying it.

train,;/COP is da bomb. I also like Bucky. Lots of people don't like Bucky because he doesn't conform to programming standards but that in my opinion is where people go wrong. Because as a noob programmer, having him use the wrong spelling or writing stupid names at times can in fact (to me anyway) actually clarify what words have to be written in a particular way and what words are just any old word that you can make up. Which I felt sometimes watching other tutorials which were so complicated I'd be overwhelmed and then I'd watch a Bucky video and be like oh damn so that is just some random crap you wanna put in. Making it more understandable. Also I think initially just getting your head around things it helps to be able to just get the code to work instead of having to make sure all of your code is up to spec.

train,;/One of the best ways to learn a new language is to solve exercises and typical code interview questions with the new language. I highly recommend you just start solving problems at i.e., [https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). If you are familiar with coding, basic math and some algorithms from college, you may have an idea how to solve the problems, and what remains then is googling how to do them in Java. This will also get you accustomed to typical programming tests. I might've suggested something else of you wanted to learn full stack Java development with typical project work, but in your case I think this is a really good approach. Either way, good luck!,;/1

train,;/The problem with this course is (although a Python dev should not worry) - while being very good - that it's absolutely massive and presented in semi-academic way. It also relies heavily on previous excercises instead of asking different solutions for similar tasks (different tasks improve actual understanding imo). That's why I put it aside at around 15% completion and started the Helsinki course, which I am really enjoying. Helsinki however makes it a tad bit harder to get feedback in case of being stuck.,;/2

In your first if, you're using curly braces, but in the subsequent ifs you're not. Always use curly braces even if they're one liners.,;/1
train,;/Thanks, good read. I’m a newbie and also preparing to write my OCA Cert Exam beginning of January. This was a bit advanced for me as I don’t yet understand maps and streams but I’ll save this and check it again when I become a pro.,;/2
train,;/Pure gold for newbies!!!,;/2
train,;/Thanks so much for compiling this! I am in the job for multiple years now and I'm still amazed how many people violate these. Especially returning null is very popular among many developers. As well as swallowing exceptions (e print stack trace). Both are absolutely horrible and will introduce a lot of errors downstream. Yet very seasoned developers constantly get this wrong!,;/2
train,;/On 2, I do absolutely love streams, but according to the articles I've read, you should still use regular loops if the loop solution is as readable and easy to understand as the stream solution, which it will sometimes be. Sometimes the for-version is even easier to read. When I was doing AoC day 17, my solution for both parts was taking about 40 seconds to run. I went ahead and replaced the streams with for loops, and the run time went down to only 3 seconds, without making it harder to read. That's still many times longer than my solutions for the other days, and there's probably a much more efficient algorithm I could use to cut down the complexity enough that using streams would still be fine, but I don't see any point in wasting performance if it doesn't improve readability, so personally I use for loops if they're at least as readable as streams. For example, this could be written in 3 ways: for (String line : indata) { ruleList.add(new Rule(line)); } ruleList = indata.stream() .map(Rule::new) .collect(Collectors.toList()); indata.forEach(line -> ruleList.add(new Rule(line))); Running 10 tests processing 136 lines, the average run times were (in milliseconds, in order): 2.55, 3.79, 3.01, and while that's not a big deal, I don't see any point in using the functional versions when they're slower and arguably harder to read. If I were to explain it to the duck, I'd say something along the lines of "for each line in indata, add it as a new Rule to the ruleList". The for-loop is the closest to matching that sentence. The .forEach is almost the same, but it moves "indata" up to the start, so it's not quite as good. https://blog.jooq.org/2015/12/08/3-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-replace-your-for-loops-by-stream-foreach/,;/2
train,;/> Always use curly braces even if they're one liners. Absolutely this.,;/1
train,;/I absolutely agree, probably I missed that because all I can see here is the lack of enum and switch statement:) I think I’ll create another post with things you guys spotted, before that I’ll of course create new PR and fix it.,;/1
train,;/Hi, thanks for this comment. You are right however I would add two things to that. 1. There is something like JIT ([https://aboullaite.me/understanding-jit-compiler-just-in-time-compiler/](https://aboullaite.me/understanding-jit-compiler-just-in-time-compiler/)) which optimizes your code in runtime over time and afaik it will probably optimize this stream to for loop 2. Sometimes you might use .paralell() with your stream which will give you even faster results than the for loop but the disadvantage is that they run in common fork-join thread pool, more details here [https://dzone.com/articles/think-twice-using-java-8](https://dzone.com/articles/think-twice-using-java-8) In software development there is always a tradeoff, here is a pretty nice example of readability and simplicity of code vs performance,;/3
train,;/Good point! Simplicity is important, and often doing things in the most direct and clear way is best.,;/1
train,;/That's fair, although based on the runtimes, this one does not get optimized. The difference is not huge, but it was clear and consistent. EDIT: Actually read the link now, I guess you might be right. I thought the JIT only ran once, I didn't realize that it kept optimizing over time. Thanks!,;/1
train,;/It's just repetition. Build more projects, do more tutorials. The more you do the better you'll get.. no one is just born a talented programmer.,;/2
train,;/Things click slowly, practice it you got it! You'll learn lots of little behaviors, but you will also hit milestone breakthroughs in understanding. Your dad is explaining from a different perspective because he's hit those milestones so he views it different, trust me you'll get there.,;/1
train,;/You shouldn't be. Keep going! You got this!,;/2
train,;/i was in the same boat last year when i started learning software engineering at college literally for the first 2 months i did not know what i was learning then it just clicked just practice and repeat everything repeats untill you reach a point that you got everything also three more things that helped me compare the code to real stuff in real life like objects and methods, if you are not sure if you can do a project just start it and when you reach a wall you can watch a tutorial or a documentation on what is stopping you just start typing code for now and do the simple stuff first and lastly something that helped me a lot with arrays is draw the array and try to draw what happens each loop or what you are trying to accomplish this will make arrays 10x easier also good luck and dont worry and just go for it by time you will have your own ways,;/1
train,;/Every programmer feels that till they die.,;/2
train,;/Also, don’t feel bad if you have to review a lot of basics over and over again until it starts to make sense. I was in your same shoes until a few months ago. Also working on a Java program for school. I reviewed and worked on a lot of basic stuff and watched videos of other people building stuff out and talking out their thought process. My degree is online and self paced so I was able to kind of step back and focus on basics before moving forward. Maybe consider doing that on your free time as well.,;/1
train,;/That's true, I try to watch videos but it doesn't always stick (only for a short time),;/2
train,;/Can attest. Though it is nice knowing other people are miserable with me.,;/2
train,;/Watching videos just to watch them generally isn't that useful. The thing that really helped me learn was finding a project that I was excited about, and asking "what's the next thing I can do to building this". One of the very first programs I wrote on my own was a simple guess the number game. The game would ask the player how many number to guess from. For each guess it would tell the player if they were too high or too low. It kept track of how many guesses the player took to win the game, and at the end if they took too many guesses it would insult them.,;/1
train,;/Looks like you’re in the stage where you like to talk about learning instead of learning. It’s good to vent. Then after continue reading, watching tutorials, and practice more. Because the former does not get you better.,;/1

train,;/I completely agree. Architecture choices are a combination of requirements and the makeup of your team.,;/1
train,;/To increase your chances of employability in your pursuit, you'd require skills in: Coding, Data Structure & Algorithms, Software Engineering and Software development life cycle. \- For coding in Java I find two sources that standout amidst the sheer volume of materials out there, do them both in that order: [MOOC FI: Java I & II](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/curriculum) \- Data Structure and Algorithms there are plenty of good sources: [MIT: Intro to Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM) [Coursera Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) &#x200B; \- Software Engineering principles, SDLC, Design Patterns and Agile practices.

Just start somewhere and keep pushing. You really gotta put your heart into this from the beginning.,;/1
train,;/Get the book "crack the coding interview". There are free .pdf versions online. Learn enough Java to where you're comfortable solving several kinds of algorithms, and have a few projects that you've written on your own, preferably ones that take user input, store it in a database, and then retrieve it and show it to the user. At that point you should be ready for an entry level job.,;/1
train,;/From zero? It's extremely unlikely companies will hire you for Java development by just self-teaching for 6 months. Keep in mind that these kinds of companies generally work on rather complex software and are looking for software engineers, not 'programmers'.,;/1
train,;/Probably not something you want to hear, but I believe it going to be a little difficult to learn Java in 6 months and be job-ready.But I can offer you a little strategy to start. You haven't mentioned that if you have any prior coding experience, assuming you don't. I would suggest starting with a book, Cay Horstmann's is my favorite when you little ahead, start with an online program and follow along. While you feel you are confident navigating different aspects of that language start with data structures & algorithms, learn each of them with care, get comfortable with writing them, implementing them on your own. After that, I would suggest starting a little on design patterns too. I hope this helps and once you are confident enough to start solving leetcode / hackerrank problems, spend time with that along with your study.,;/1
train,;/Speaking as a beginner with maybe 8 months behind me (alongside work and school). The roadmap is having a shit ton of time within those six months. Incredible focus. Good discipline and good learning skills I like how I’ve progressed. In a way that I try to truly understand what I’m learning and not rushing to learn exactly the technologies I need for employment. I did mooc. Learned a little bit about programming and OOP. I read head first alongside. Then I started cs50. I’d say do this first, but at the same time I feel like I absorbed cs50 and c better with a little bit of java knowledge. On the flip side c knowledge will help you learn and appreciate java. So even though it’s a roundabout way. I like how higher level to lower level and back to higher level is panning out. I’m currently learning DS in C for an under the hood understanding, then I will get into the algorithms in java Again. This is from a beginner perspective. And I can confidently say I am no where near in a position where I would be or would like to be employed in this field.,;/1
train,;/Start here: [https://java-programming.mooc.fi](https://java-programming.mooc.fi),;/3
train,;/I've been using JetBrains academy and an app called SoloLearn on android (also, free). They are both awesome, and I highly recommend. Jetbrains gets you into using the IDE, and I use SoloLearn to help reinforce things I learn through little quizzes. Thanks for the list of more resources, Hoxeon! Have you ever heard of exercism.io ? Seems pretty intimidating, but very interesting.,;/3
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/Yeah I’m with you on this. Learning a bit of code to automate something isn’t too hard but working on bigger projects takes knowledge of algorithms, data structures, some math, design, a lot of troubleshooting. You require a wide breadth of knowledge to truly be effective and all these online courses paint a rosy picture of “become an engineer this weekend while learning python” which is misleading and detrimental. Not trying to rain on their parade but you can’t reasonably learn this stuff in such a short period.,;/2
train,;/I’m wondering how someone could learn programming for 4 months without knowing what object oriented programming is.,;/0
train,;/This is actually really helpful,;/2
train,;/interesting article! I figured out a lot of what this guy is saying....Im trying to make a career shift from Chemistry to Game and app development. What this guy says about learning the basics is very true. Really learning the basics will make attacking more advanced concepts like 10 times easier because you arent lost in simple definitions. Its definitely worth your while to take your time learning than rushing through the learning process. Ive personally found it fulfilling to take my time combing through core Java. Since taking my time, Ive noticed that a lot of things that completely went over my head while trying to dabble in Android now make complete sense. Patience is a virtue if you really want to be great as a developer. If you have a career that pays the bills already, use that as a foundation to work on being a good developer. Ive been working on really understanding java for about 3 months so far and im gonna give myself about 5 months more of learning and building before finding something more advanced to learn from then pursue my OCAJP.,;/1
train,;/Damn, curiosity should be the Main reason after all, to go into coding. I always struggled to get into development due to my laughable math skills. It seems that I was obsessed with math and what not but forgot the most important thing - the curiosity itself. Food for thoughts for sure.,;/2
train,;/This is good advice for someone struggling with even basic syntax,;/2

train,;/Mods should sticky this thread.,;/2
train,;/I personally would put Spring in Action way ahead of some other books on this list, for the following reasons: 1) The grand majority of Java jobs in the industry will be Spring based projects. Sure Spring is not Java, but I'd argue Kotlin also isn't, and Spring would be more useful than Kotlin as far as finding an entry level position. (Keeping in mind this subreddit is for beginners) 2) I can't think of another series of books that is as up to date and keeps up with the changing tech landscape as well as SiA. There are 5 versions of SiA. Every time Spring goes up a version, the books gets updated and a new edition is published. You get to avoid so many headaches that are so common to reading out of date tech books. 3) It's an absolute gem. Be you a beginner, or advanced Spring user, everyone can learn a great deal from this well maintained, up to date publication, and greatly written publication.,;/1
train,;/I would rule all these books out over Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures by Y. Daniel Yang. It's a comprehensive version consist of basically everything what's out there in the java world.,;/1

train,;/Thanks for your suggestion. That is the main reason why I posted it to reddit. I agree, for finding a job Spring is the way to go. I will update the article in a while and make sure to include SiA. Probably also add something like "Cloud Native Java".,;/2
train,;/>I would rule all these books out over Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures by Y. Daniel Yang.

A lot of these Basics (as algorithms and data structures) were more or less just mandatory for my studies and thats why I never needed to pick up a book (outside of the lectures) . Like I stated, I want to improve this article over time, I will try to get my hands on it and see if I can recommend it. Thanks for your input. Much appreciated.,;/1

train,;/Oracle is offering a Java course for its 25th anniversary.

Link to course: https://education.oracle.com/java-25th-anniversary-discount-redemption Edit: Typo & Link to course,;/3
train,;/This is a good thing in disguise. More java experience is good and learning it as well. What you need to do is become comfortable with Java over the next 6 months to a year, do some interview prep and jump ship (or get an offer and use it to negotiate for more money at your current job). Also remember to push back on deadlines if they feel unrealistic. If you already have some programming knowledge I'd recommend you watch this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPvGqX-TXP0&ab_channel=DerekBanas Also IDK what IDE you use, but if you want to use Eclipse for the purpose of the above video that's fine, but almost every company uses IntelliJ (just pointing this out as IntelliJ is way better than eclipse imho and more widely used).,;/1
train,;/In my honest opinion, you should tell your boss sooner rather than later. It's okay not to know something. You don't want it coming out any later than it needs to. Also, what is your background? Are you a dev and just haven't exactly worked with Java? Personally, I would not want someone working on a project that doesn't understand the language in use ... Imagine a strictly English speaker trying to run a negotiation in a foreign country. If you keep trying to "Frankenstein" it; you're likely gonna make a future dev's life a living hell.,;/1
train,;/I would inform the boss person about risks and upcoming studying you need to be working as java dev. And just in case maybe check existing java vacancies and check what is required. I bet there are things like git, gradle, springboot, jpa, rest and other spookie things. Depending on that learn things and negotiate the way to solve prod issues if you hit a limit of your knowledge. Like could you consult with the author person maybe in such case?,;/0

train,;/Thank you for the post. I wish I knew about this sooner. Currently a junior Java developer. Do you think it's possible to take this test with 1 month of prep? We are currently using Java 8 and the Spring framework for backend development at work.,;/0
train,;/Haven't touched java since JDK 1.4. Does the IDE matter a lot? I think I used jdeveloper then.,;/0
train,;/In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with trying. Even if you can't pass the exam, you would have learned a lot during the course. The total course content is about \~35 hours so 2 hours per day along with practice would be more than enough. The main point here is to learn since skills are the main determinate of your position in the software industry.,;/1
train,;/Plain and simple most people use IntelliJ so that's good enough reason for me to use it more. Other than that the dependency management is better, the plugin manager is better (for my case my company uses a custom plugin with IntelliJ), and I like the debugger more. I haven't used Eclipse in ages, but the last time I used it, it was for C++ which was pure garbage.,;/1
train,;/It matters that you use a modern IDE, but which one you choose is less important. Intellij is popular. Eclipse and NetBeans less popular but still functional. They help in big ways. You don't have to remember how to spell or remember what methods are available, because the ide will autocomplete and list available suggestions as you type. It will also search across the entire code base to do things like rename a variable (in all files where it is referenced) or find all usages of a method (in all files). It's still of course possible to write and compile and run Java without an IDE but the level of effort and time to get the same outcome in a large codebase would be much higher.,;/1

train,;/When will you add new levels?,;/0
train,;/Currently, the course has one level, but it'll be updated to 5 levels. OOP is not in the first level. In the next level, I'll add OOP and will be explained through practical examples. I know OOP is one of the most important part of Java, but I decided not to add too much content to the first level. I think dividing the content into levels can help a lot because it's easier to digest and see the progress.,;/1
train,;/That makes sense. The course looks awesome Btw!,;/2
train,;/This is a good story. I too am experiencing this; I recently got my first job as a junior developer working in Java. Every *single* day is a struggle because every day I have to do something new. So I sit there, go "How do I implement a regex into a Java application?" and then I read S.O. and the Java docs and Google pages for hours. Then I come up with a few answers and try them all out. Sometimes they work. Sometimes they don't. Then I present my successes/failures to my boss, and he helps me understand what went right/wrong, or shows me a better way to do it. It's a really amazing feeling to realize, you can learn *anything* if you put in the work and ignore the voice in your head that tells you "You can't do this.",;/2
train,;/It's a great feeling. Chase it to the ends of the Earth,;/2
train,;/I really needed to hear this! Thank you OP! I’m going to really try on MOOC now.,;/2

train,;/Wait for the second half, those easy first gains disappeared for me. I've been stuck on week 10's final exercise for days now, and finally at 5am today I think I have a pseudo code solution. Worth it though!,;/2
train,;/I feel totally the same way. I work as a front end dev and I am trying to learn java as my work uses it on the back end. I went through the MOOC courses before starting my CS masters program(business undergrad). They expect you to know how to code in java, I finished Helinski MOOC just in time!,;/2
train,;/I'm halfway through it, it's really good, you should.,;/2
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/Dude I’m looking forward to it. It can be so infuriating, but when it finally works.. Such a great fucking feeling.,;/2
train,;/Yeah thats the ones.,;/2
train,;/Dumb questions are totally okay. Everyone has to start somewhere. A class is like a blueprint for an object, it tells you what fields and methods it should have. Once you have a class you can create multiple instances of it, and each instance can have different data. For example you might have a class Enemy that has a health pool and a damage value: public class Enemy { private int health; private int damage; //... } A constructor is a method that gets called once per instance and only when that object is being created. It lets you initialize values before the object is used. //this would go inside the Enemy class, just below the private fields //Unlike other methods, constructors have no return type public Enemy(int startingHeath, int startingDamage) { this.health = startingHealth; this.damage = startingDamage; } Now you can create Enemies using the constructor: Enemy goomba = new Enemy(1, 1); Enemy bowser = new Enemy(25, 3); goomba and bowser are instances of the Enemy class, and each have totally separate values for health and damage. Let me know if this makes sense or if you have more questions.,;/1
train,;/Some pretty thorough responses already posted but I'm going to chime in with a very basic explanation. Let's say you are writing a program to build a city. In the city you have "classes" which represent items you find in a city. For example there is a class for "buildings" which defines the characteristics of a building (address, windows, doors, stories, whatever), there is a class for parks that defines what a park has, a class for cars that represent all the features required for a car, etc etc. Now you have a class that defines what a building is, but you haven't built any buildings yet. So inside of your building class you write a constructor that creates new buildings, defining what the address for that specific building is, how many windows it has, how many stories tall, etc. So, anytime you need a new building, new car, new park, etc you call the appropriate constructor and give it the required specifications.,;/1
train,;/Constructor is the code that lets you create a class (an 'object') and will perform any setup that is needed before it can be used. Also known as initializing an object,;/1
train,;/I just took my first Java course so I’m not an expert, but my understanding is that a constructor creates the framework that allows you to create objects from that class. If your constructor has parameters, you can include those when you create your object in a different class. So a line of code like: `Class class = new Class (param1, param2);` Creates a new object “class” of class “Class” with parameters for your predefined values. Hopefully somebody more knowledgeable can expand on this, but that’s the gist of it.,;/1
train,;/I ramble quite a bit and this probably isn't the best example but, hope it helps you understand constructors a little better. Hopefully I didn't leave any typos! Say you're making a batch of sugar cookies and you have two batches of dough (one extra sweet and one regular sweetness). You have 2 cookie cutters, one is star shaped and one is circle shaped. A constructor for this scenario might look like: `Public class SugarCookie() {` `String sugar;` `int flour;` `string shape;` `public SugarCookie(int sugar, int flour, String shape) {` `this.sugar = sugar; this.flour = flour; this.shape = shape } }` (sorry idk how to indent properly in the reddit text box) To create a sugar cookie, you'd utilize the constructor I made `public SugarCookie(int sugar, int flour, String shape)`: `SugarCookie sugarCookie1 = new SugarCookie("extra sweet", 10, "star")` Now I've created an individual cookie (object) called cookie1 using the SugarCookie constructor because this cookie I'm creating is a sugar cookie. The "extra sweet" = how much sugar is in the cookie, 10 = flour, and star = shape. Now let's make another cookie using the SAME batch of dough using the other cookie cutter. `SugarCookie sugarCookie2 = new SugarCookie("extra sweet", 10, "circle")` Notice the only difference here is I'm inputting a different shape because we're using the same dough. BUT they're both using the same constructor because they're both SugarCookies. Last example...let's make a star shaped cookie with regular sweetness.: `SugarCookie sugarCookie3 = new SugarCookie("regular sweetness", 10, "star");` Actually, let's make two of those. `SugarCookie sugarCookie4 = new SugarCookie("regular sweetness", 10, "star");` I'm still using the SugarCookie constructor because what makes our cookies doesn't change from sugar cookie to sugar cookie; every cookie is defined by the sugar, flour, and the shape of the cookie. Now that you have 4 SugarCookies, you can reference each one individually. Even though sugarCookie3 and sugarCookie4 are functionally the same (they're made exactly the same) , they're still two individual cookies. This means you can reference each cookie individually. e.g you want to eat your extra sweet cookies first: eatingACookie(sugarCookie1); eatingACookie(sugarCookie2); &#x200B; I'm probably too new to programming to be able to put down the literal purpose of a constructor but hopefully this example helps.,;/1
train,;/A Java constructor is special method that is called when an object is instantiated. In other words, when you use the new keyword. The purpose of a Java constructor is to initializes the newly created object before it is used. Also I use the channel with quiz questions which helps me to practice similar questions https://t.me/topJavaQuizQuestions,;/1
train,;/This is a great, straight forward explanation.,;/2
train,;/This was perfect! Thank you so much.,;/2
train,;/Great explanation!,;/2
train,;/The best thing about this example is it really explains how to use classes I think. Classes actually used to really confuse me until I took a course in programming. Without explaining constructors alongside I always used to think it was pointless to make multiples of the same object with the same parameters. While I'm sure there's a use for that last scenario, it's a lot easier to understand that I'm making a thing that produces a lot of slightly different things to fit my purpose, and that's really hard to get without knowing what use the constructor has.,;/2

The core spring path is well structured (around 13 courses where each one is about 2h). I recommend you to learn solid principles, unit and integration Testing (at least the basics). I'm trying to learn well this topic because in my company we use spring (old version) and lot of bad practices, so I'm trying to learn the good practices in my own time.

train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/>What is the meaning of "Dude like problem with me"? I think he meant "Dude like **the** problem with me is different",;/1
train,;/Honestly, there are better resources than these. Stanford's class on algorithms (also on coursera) is much better.,;/1
train,;/I have to disagree that Stanford's is better. I will say that Stanford's is more rigorous mathematically. He assumes you've taken discrete math, and probability, and he also throws in some calculus a few times. He also speaks very quickly and has handwriting that's hard to read. And the pseudocode presented is not enough to understand how to implement some of the data structures or algorithms if you haven't already done it before. It's just too vague and glosses over some of the most difficult edge cases you have to be aware of to get them to work. Princeton's course has real code examples in java so you can really see it, but you still get practice implementing things on your own. It's also less rigorous mathematically and in my opinion they did a better job explaining some of the required background knowledge instead of just assuming it. It's more practical and has less analysis. I can't say Stanford's course was bad, but it was just not for me. I found it very hard to follow. I'd recommend Princeton if you want to see some real code in Java, or MIT's OCW algorithms course in python, which has the side benefit that it's the first in a three part series on algorithms, so you can stick around and get into some of the more advanced stuff.,;/1
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/I haven't tried Stanford's class. I'll take your word for it 😁,;/2
train,;/Does the Stanford one provide problem sets to work through or are they just video lectures?,;/0
train,;/If this is the course I think of (Design and analysis of algorithms), it was also on Coursera long time ago, but I can't find it any more. If this is the one, I think it has different goals than these two. Stanford course focuses on theoretical part of algorithms, and is more math heavy. These two Princeton classes have more practical, hands-on approach to developing algorithms using theoretical foundation. In my opinion, it would be best to do both courses. You get both theoretical and practical knowledge.,;/1
train,;/Stanford was once free on the Stanford Lagunita website. Not anymore :(.,;/2
train,;/It has problem sets and some of them are pretty hard. Like, implement some recursive algorithm based on vague pseudocode and count how many times it recurses for a provided data set, then enter that number as the solution. If you handle the base case or edge cases differently you end up with a different number, so you're kind of left guessing to get it just right even if your algorithm works.,;/1
train,;/Yeah the Stanford course used to be called that but they updated it and made it into four courses with some new content and named it the algorithms specialization. It is much more theoretical. Kind of like a second course in algorithms instead of an introduction.,;/1
train,;/Does that mean in a real world situation your algorithm would still work but in this scenario they're looking for an exact solution that isn't provided so you can't even check your work? Still learning so forgive my ignorance.,;/0

train,;/For the first few months, I struggled to even remember the syntax of for-loops and really couldn't wrap my head around the zero-based indexes. I stumbled over the most basic stuff and felt like I could never do any better. But the thing is, I thoroughly enjoyed it all. I was in constant awe when I got something to work (even if it was botched by the next line of code). For my first year of coding courses, I basically did all the exercises and then some coding of my own, trying out stuff and playing with the code. I knew it was my thing, right from the get-go. The code I wrote was atrocious for the first two years, and then I'd say I was rather mediocre for about five years after that and only started to learn proper ways of doing things about three years ago. I don't think I'm a genius and I still have a lot to learn all the time, but that's part of the fun for me. My advice is to just be stupid and feel stupid and play around with code.,;/1
train,;/You don't need to be a genius, you just need to plan, create, and implement an algorithm. The human mind is not great at dealing with huge complex problems so we create an algorithm and break one big complex problem down into small simple problems and solve each one and piece them back together. So we're only solving a whole bunch of simple problems. You don't need to be a genius for that. As for doing thing the best, most efficient way, well, I guess that comes with experience.,;/1
train,;/I didn't understand the very basics for a very long time. How the main method worked and instance variables were really confusing to me. Objects? The fuck knows what are those. Methods? Why is my static method call not compiling? Who knows. People mocked me as useless. But I persisted, and now I work as a Software Engineer and Java is my main language. I have a hunger to do what I do better. To learn more about Java and other languages and environments. Programming is for geniuses but also for people that don't give up.,;/1
train,;/It is normal to feel a little discouraged when you can't understand concepts in the beginning, but the learning builds upon simple steps. The steps have to be small initially, but the experience of learning Java gets fascinating after a little while. I cannot emphasize PRACTICE enough. Imagine a problem, and solve it with Java as much as possible. Also, make notes as you learn. Cram.com is a great (free) tool for making notes you can access from anywhere as long you have an Internet connection. When it comes to programming, it is imperative to think logically and critically. When you run into programming obstacles, remember to keep calm and approach how to solve the issue rationally. Like the others are saying, resources like Stack Overflow, Geeks for Geeks etc. are abound nowadays and there are excellent inputs from folks on these sites who know what they're doing. Lastly, feeling "stupid" can be a powerful friend in the end. The times I felt "stupid", I felt discouraged, but I also had a stronger resolve to keep pushing and I can honestly say when you break through the issues, the feeling of internal reward is something else...,;/1
train,;/All of the replies on here are SUPER encouraging. Can't wait to get home from work and practice,;/2
train,;/This guy gets it 💯,;/2
train,;/So, sucess is the ability to be and feel stupid? xD Do you earn money from this?,;/0
train,;/Yeah, the algorithm thing is what I'm starting to see it's the key to understand it... I'm reading "Data Structures and Algorithms" to see if I can learn how to think in that way...,;/2
train,;/>So programming is for geniuses but also for people that don't give up. That's a genius phrase.,;/2
train,;/I think the point is that the process of learning any language (and programming in general) involves a lot mistakes and misunderstandings and to be successful you'll have to enjoy the process enough to endure those failures for a while. This was my experience as well.,;/1

Title like 'How to iterate over a List' and then a short but well explained example of it. And yes, its super hard to read, zooming is a must.

train,;/Before you completely give up I think you should try out other programming languages because a lot of it will resemble Java. Don't know what you're building but chances are there is a much cleaner language you can build it in than Java. Java is really difficult to do things in without lots and lots of guidance.

train,;/[Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/onboarding/project?track=7) has a decent selection for various skill levels. That link will take you to the "Easy" skill level. Hyperskill was recently added to the sidebar. I would recommend you set up a GitHub account, and add all side projects to it. You can then share your GitHub account on your resume. This is very useful for employers. I would even put simple projects on there. Those can show how well or poorly you comment your code (remember for comments: more is not always better). Be cautious about adding school projects. If you add them, make sure they are set to private. If you make the project publicly accessible, your school may consider it the same as giving answers to other students. My school warned us over and over about this. Their penalty is suspension and/or revocation of your degree. I added all of my projects, but set them to private. GitHub now allows for unlimited private repositories.,;/1
train,;/Never too early to start projects! My first Java project was Tic Tac Toe. I started with two player and moved on to playing against the PC. Then I made the PC unbeatable and created different difficulty leaves the user could choose from. It was a lot of fun and taught me a lot,;/1

train,;/Why the kinda fit snake?,;/0
train,;/Name of the book please,;/0
train,;/Game loop. Requires threads and listening for keyboard inputs in parallel. That is hard especially for a beginner. Making a 2d array that just waits until the player presses the keyboard to move is more feasible. Essentially you make the whole game (eat, traverse, grow, traverse from one side to the other through wall) but the actual game loop.,;/1
train,;/It is an array of String arguments that are passed into the main method from the input of the application, so for example you can run a program using: java [helloWorld.java](https://helloWorld.java) And you can also input arguments to be used by the main method using: java [helloWorld.java](https://helloWorld.java) {string1} {string2} and then in the main method you can access these values using args\[0\], args\[1\],;/1
train,;/I asked my teacher to clarify this once since it was the 5th or 6th week of class and we never actually discussed it. He proceeded to respond with “that’s a good question, can anyone answer that?” The room stayed silent and as you may assume, not much learning took place lol,;/2
train,;/The other comment is correct but some background. The java compiler actually create an object of the Main class and calls its method, main. So args is the parameter being passed in. Those parameters come from the terminal when the program is run. You can use this as a means of passing info to the program at the very start.,;/1
train,;/It's a parameter for the main method, like if you write an `add` method like `public int add(int x, int y)`, this is called the method signature, and `x` and `y` are both parameters with the type `int` for the `add` method The `main` method of all java programs are the "entry point" of your code. basically the first method to ever run and they must always include the `args` parameter with the type `String[]` which means String array. The `args` parameter is meant to hold the values of each individual "argument" that was passed to the java program before it ran, basically this is one way to feed data to your program so you can write code that reads that data and does different things from it. If you are using an IDE like Eclipse then you can find the spot to enter your arguments in the run configuration menu. If you are running your java program from a command line terminal then the arguments are what you pass it in there like the other person commented.,;/1
train,;/Real programmers google anyway, who needs teachers? /s,;/2
train,;/My teacher explained it to me, I think it's like sth to do with passing arguments via the terminal! Idk I didn't really understand much!,;/2
train,;/It's pretty shocking if you're being taught that the teacher doesn't even know this.,;/2
train,;/> The java compiler actually create an object of the Main class and calls its method, main. The runtime actually if we're being pedantic ;) The java compiler (javac) doesn't call anything, it just compiles Java to bytecode. And the JIT compiler also doesn't call anything; it just compiles bytecode to machine code :),;/1
train,;/> The java compiler actually create an object of the Main class and calls its method, main No instance of the Main class is created (unless you create one yourself in the `main` method). The `main` method is static and does not need to be called on an instance.,;/1
train,;/Sadly Google has taught me more at this point (it feels like),;/2
train,;/I would advise anyone starting new to not spend too much time trying to learn various languages, please spend Time on learning concept like how to analysis an algorithm like calculating time complexity ,figuring how to use do-while - for loops then move on to learning Data structure and algorithms like stack , queue , linked list , graph, tree , recursion etc If you are good in DS and algorithms , a lot of company will be willing to hire you even if you don't know the language they work on.,;/1
train,;/I disagree a bit. Especially for people who want to be more well rounded. Concentrating solely on one language may not help you later on when you need to understand something else. Like someone said earlier about java: understanding an OOP language helped tremendously with using other OOP languages. So even though I started with java, I learned JavaScript and Python at the same time. I thought it was more beneficial. I think overloading is not good at all, but mixing 2-3 languages (especially if you’re learning one for back end and one for front end) helps tremendously later on.,;/1
train,;/I think you really need at least two languages, JavaScript and the one you concentrate on. Without JavaScript, you are lost in web UI and restricted to backend where Java is so great. As a beginner, you need to be able to do Full Stack or it will be too restrictive ... this will also bring in SQL. Sorry about that, we're up to three already.,;/1
train,;/It’s hard not to jump from language to language in college because that’s how the degree program is structured.,;/2
train,;/While I agree that you should not spend too much time learning various languages and rather focus on the things you listed, languages can teach you important concepts as well. Yeah, most languages are multi-paradigm languages. But I think it is easier to learn functional programming with something other than Java. I also would advise to learn a dynamically typed and a statically typed language so you get to know the differences. One of the important questions here is: what do we classify as a beginner programmer? First weeks? First months? First year? Because yes, during the first weeks you should just stick to one language and learn everything from loops and conditions to the data structures of your language. First months? You can (and should) pick up another language. (Second half of) First year? You should start caring about good code (patterns, SOLID, whatever). And all of this depends on how much time you can devote to learning - some can learn 5h per week, some can spend 40h per week... The first months of one can take another person years.,;/1
train,;/For people who don't have a programming background, it's not very efficient to learn multiple languages when you are just starting out. It's better to specialize so that you learn the fundamental programming principles, explore data structures, algorithms, frameworks, and etc without having to juggle between X languages, syntax, and etc. This way they can get a job quicker then decide to learn other languages if needed/want to.,;/1
train,;/And whats bad about beeing backend only? 🧐,;/0
train,;/4 semesters, 6 languages (C, C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, Python). Tbh: I liked it.,;/2
train,;/Yeah a college degree is a little different because y’all don’t have a choice. I was more referring to people who aren’t in a CS degree program,;/2
train,;/I think that at least when starting out you should understand apps end to end. Any hole in your knowledge will gnaw at you. Later, we all specialize and the field is so enormous it will be even more so.,;/1
train,;/I used to run study groups on here. I could do that again -- I am writing a book about getting a job as a programmer ([https://ZeroToCode.today](https://zerotocode.today/)) and was thinking about dropping some chapters of here 2-3 days a week and running study groups based off of it. Would people be interested? Book is entirely free online.,;/0
train,;/Tutorials are over rated. Do one or two just to understand syntax and the main ideas. But other than that just start making something. Working through 1 project (even a small one) will teach you more than 100 tutorials would.,;/1
train,;/I am in this picture and I dont like it,;/2
train,;/Then you go watch the tutorial again, copy the code, hit npm run start, and it still doesn't work for some unknown reason.,;/2
train,;/I mean the only way to learn is to actually do projects,;/2
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/Honestly so true. Big caveat: I do like tutorials for brand-brand-new-stuff. Before I even knew what console.log was, I did Colt Steele’s Web Developer boot camp. Massively helpful. I didn’t learn very deeply (didn’t understand much) but I learned by imitation. After finishing the Udemy course I was asked by my dad to make a site for his company as a nice-to-have side project. Nothing critical, compensation possible, the perfect learning project (user feedback too)! I immediately fell on my face. Didn’t understand how to setup express, even after making our Udemy capstone project “YelpCamp”. So, I got started imitating everything from the Udemy course. It’s here when I started copying and adjusting code that what I was doing started to sink in. I first needed the exposure to express and bootstrap etc... from Udemy (you don’t know what you don’t know), but now that I had the exposure, my eyes were comfortable with what was on the screen so my brain was freed up to actually understand it, if that makes sense. Fast forward a month and I’ve got a functional app with my mongodb database, file storage via aws S3, magic link auth using jwt and session cookies (once authenticated via link). It’s funny because now I’m going back to Udemy to learn more (especially SPA stuff) and I was looking into a “nodejs api masterclass” course and realized that I had already learned and implemented basically all the stuff in the course. Session cookies, file upload/download, jwts for auth and your standard mongoose queries. So long story short, do the tutorial for something brand-brand new just to get a feel for the landscape and syntax, then imitate the shit out of it to build your own project. That’s when things start to click and you start to get curious and eventually end up learning a whole lot more. Aside: learning web development is like learning spoken language. Imitate, imitate, imitate (learn the sounds, the common phrases, get your mouth moving)... then go out and try to hold a conversation (understand what you’re actually saying and what you need to learn).,;/2
train,;/I kind of agree. When you follow tutorials you just repeat what it's done but you don't really understand why. One of the best way to understand why is to be confronted to the problem.,;/2
train,;/How do you start doing projects without knowing anything though? I'm in that weird spot where I'm almost done with a Udemy course, and I understand things when as the instructor is going through things. But when it comes to starting from scratch building something I wouldn't know the first thing.,;/0

train,;/I've been employed as a Javascript developer for two and a half years, I'm still learning Javascript. But I'm also still learning Ruby and Clojure and Rust. The idea that you have to 'master' something to pick up something else is silly.,;/2
train,;/Yeah what other careers call "job training" we just call our job.,;/2
train,;/And hey, with a background in politics, if programming doesn't work out, you can become a Product Manager. It's like being a politician for code, but instead of re-elections you have sprints.,;/2
train,;/What if I've already learnt JavaScript? Should I try to forget what I know and start with Java?,;/0
train,;/I've written JS almost every day for the last 9 years. &#x200B; So do I.,;/2
train,;/Ah well, at least we're paid really well,;/2
train,;/I think it can help to switch to something different for a while. JS forced me to rethink a lot of practices I got used to in PHP. Then going back to PHP, I found I did things differently, and I think better. Programming languages are like natural languages. You can study the grammar and vocabulary all you want, but fluency comes from use.,;/1
train,;/Nice. I prefer the original though: https://i.redd.it/yf7rw3pjiapx.jpg Edit, not sure if source but it is the earliest I've seen: https://twitter.com/steveluscher/status/741089564329054208,;/3
train,;/the best explanation in one picture )),;/2
train,;/let me reduce you some fruits,;/2
train,;/I get quite annoyed that people make map, filter and reduce seem difficult. They are so simple and easy to uunderstand. A nested for loop is much harder to understand and I never see much info on it,;/2
train,;/Nice,;/2
train,;/The first time that reduce has made sense to me, cheers.,;/2
train,;/Who made this and where can I find more examples like these?,;/0
train,;/Learning is a subjective experience, people learn at different rates and understand concepts differently.,;/2
train,;/Im going to go have to go look up reduce because it’s the only one that doesn’t make sense to me :/,;/2

train,;/This is giving me PTSD from Codewars katas where you have to deal with huge numbers.,;/2
train,;/Yeah this one is awesome. It can help drastically when you have a bunch of config numbers for things like cache time. We actually enforce this code style for any numbers greater than 5 digits at my workplace, using [`eslint-plugin-unicorn`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn) and its [`numeric-separators-style` rule](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/ce6500a3aebfa327ae4cf7b5bf2376aae7c2aab0/docs/rules/numeric-separators-style.md).,;/1
train,;/This is practically witchcraft, but the good kind!,;/2
train,;/if irs a number like this one you can also write it like "1e9",;/2
train,;/What app is that? Looks awesome!,;/0
train,;/In case anyone's wondering about browser compatibility: https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_grammar_numeric_separators tl;dr it's probably best to make sure your transpiler of choice covers this feature.,;/3
train,;/It looks like https://carbon.now.sh/,;/3

train,;/cringe,;/2
train,;/Could someone explain the joke because this sounds like a joke a junior or inexperienced dev would make.,;/0
train,;/x64 assembly: rules don't even exist /s,;/2

train,;/Meanwhile, on [Stack Overflow](https://i.imgur.com/a103p0g.png)...,;/3
train,;/Ah, the Meowbook Purr, finally a feline friendly alternative to Windogs!,;/2
train,;/I'm just glad the answers here aren't like Stack Overflow where *every fucking answer is* "just use jQuery",;/2
train,;/aw this is cute,;/2
train,;/🎶*Thunder thunder thunder Cats!*🎶,;/2
train,;/[deleted],;/4
train,;/People on stack overflow need to realize that they aren’t just answering the OP, they are answering every programmer who Googles those keywords... for possibly decades. The amount of people who will forever be remembered as that one asshole on a SO thread is too damn high.,;/2
train,;/I see very many people complaining about unhelpful answers on StackOverflow, but at the end of the day very many questions are of the type "hey guys I'm trying to insert these two metal picks into someone's brain, how much force should I apply?". you *could* answer with what sort of hammer he should be using and what angle is recommended for a lobotomy, but a more responsible approach would be to question why exactly he's exploring lobotomy and inform him about anti-depressants. the big issue is that people can get pretty defensive about that. "my method *works* so can you just help me with that", and simply believe the answers are unhelpful. then of course there's the jerks that simply berate you for trying to do something that isn't Certified Cool™, but I feel those are pretty far and between, even on StackOverflow.,;/1
train,;/Or solving the person's particular problem without solving the text of the question, then becoming the only high ranking result on that question.,;/2
train,;/Personally, I find a lot of the "why the fuck are you trying to write JavaScript in Python? Use list comprehension you dumb fucking bitch" posts pretty helpful. I feel like the duplicate demarcation is less helpful. It's the absolute worst when you put in "I found X but couldn't understand the answer" and then someone is just like "HEY IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEARCHED FOR THE ANSWER AND FOUND X YOU IDIOT SHUT UP GET OFF THE SITE IF YOU'RE A BEGINNER GO BACK TO FREECODECAMP SO I CAN GET BACK TO BERATING UNITY USERS FOR NOT USING UNREAL AND UNREAL USERS FOR NOT CODING THEIR GAMES ENTIRELY IN ASSEMBLY CODE",;/2
train,;/In my case, I use const. Y'all can use let. Edit: to clear up any misunderstanding, here ya go https://youtu.be/AuBC2cwVnG4,;/2
train,;/Now wearing one million masks and counting. Also snake_case & CapitalCase combined? Wtf,;/2
train,;/But... there's no exit condition. Is this the secret to immortality?,;/0
train,;/That won't pass any sane linting rulesets.,;/2
train,;/\- use of var \- snake case variable naming \- upper camel case method naming \- use of while loop Yikes man,;/2
train,;/Inconsistent variable naming conventions.,;/2
train,;/Using const is more optimistic about your chances of staying alive.,;/2

train,;/For anyone still struggling to get used to javascript, i suggest you guys try to hardcode the HTML entirely in javascript. create your website with javascript, with document.createElement, and set the styles in javascript as-well, and append it where you want it to go with document.append() though, you should never style your documents through javascript in real projects. This is what made me really get used to the javascript language and made me comfortable enough to break out off tutorial hell.,;/1
train,;/I'm a bootcamp instructor and today we are presenting our second projects - API calls with React. This post is great and I am going to send it to the class when the day is over, I love its message and I agree with it fully,;/1
train,;/This is so true. There IS an in between solution, however. Start a tutorial, and use it for the high-level guidance, but don't copy the code. Just implement your own designs, your own routing, etc, only using the tutorial for the app idea etc. This has worked for me, especially where I find a tutorial that is otherwise good except for the fact that the front end looks awful and lazily designed! EDIT: currently doing this with Grider's Full Stack React which is honestly a disappointing project in how it looks but also massively out of date, so the manual refresh is necessary. I'm building it with Material UI, modern Stripe API, and better routing (so far) with more changes to come.,;/1
train,;/I recently wanted to learn JS but I don’t learn with books or reading with no concrete purpose. So I just started writing my site and when I got to the point I needed JS, I just started googling. Hacking together a solution taught me the fundamentals and it was pure joy when I got my page to do what I wanted. It was nothing special, but I decided to create filtering buttons which would filter data on client side to save backend cpu work and db queries.,;/2
train,;/Also tell them that the bootcamp projects are the literal minimum for consideration. Im currently reviewing/vetting applicants for a jr role and 90% just have the *same* bootcamp projects listed. Literally anything puts you up a notch. Personal site, at a real url (and not just at herokuapp) takes you out of the discard pile. edit: looks like heroku wants you to at least pay for a hobby teir before giving you an ssl. you may be able to use cloudflare: https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205893698-Configure-Cloudflare-and-Heroku-over-HTTPS or another free/cheap ssl provider to serve heroku over ssl.,;/1
train,;/wow this is the best thing I heard today. I'm so glad you're doing this, wish your students best of luck in their careers,;/2
train,;/Honestly even if you keep the project functionally the same but just changing topic also does a great job (this advice is more geared to someone earlier in learning process, the above comment I agree with when you’re a little further along in the process). Example: tutorial topic is building a CRUD application for a musician booking program. I would recommend simply changing your project to be a hotel booking or catering booking program. Functionally these projects would match verrrry closely to the one in the tutorial. But just needing to rename and tweak some functions will FORCE you to pay attention to the code you’re writing. When you do the same project as the tutorial, a lot of people simply copy the code and don’t really force themselves to understand it. After you get a good grasp, then I would recommend moving on to following tutorials as a general guide or for reference material as u/not_a_gummy said. Next progression after tutorials is build your own projects using your previous projects you worked on as references and relying on reading the docs and googling for SPECIFIC parts your stuck on (I.e. don’t google how do I make a crud application, but maybe how do implement authentication using JWT or how do I implement route guards). As you learn your questions should be getting more and more targeted.,;/1
train,;/Yes, I recommend the Modern Javascript from the beginning course because you can find good project ideas in this course,;/1
train,;/Your thoughts of applicants that went to a bootcamp? I'm considering going to one but it's a big investment. I'm thinking the structure and the connections would be well worth it. I've applied for jobs and have been close twice, but I'm missing something for sure. I probably need more full-fledged/bigger projects and apps; as well as working with more frameworks. Going down the web development path btw.,;/0
