# Reddit Dialogue Model

## Overview
This was a final project for a course I took at Brandeis University called _Natural Language Annotation for Machine Learning_. I was curious as to if a model could predit the type of comment a user made on a reddit post. <br><br>
This project focused on annotating a collected data set to provide our hand-rolled model with training, validation and test data. I collected around 4000 comments and posts from the top 10 software subreddits to perform dialogue annotation.<br>

## Details
This is a sequential ML model created with keras. This project was created in Spring of 2021 and includes outdated dependencies. Unfortuantely, do to the age of some dependencies, some are no longer functional and therefore this project does not run.
If you want to run this project yourself you can clone this repo, create another main.py and port over the current code for my model using brand new dependencies. Likely the new keras or pytorch.
